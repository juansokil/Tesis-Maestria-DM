The present research explored the impact of gender-professional identity integration (GPII), a measure of how much two identities overlap, on job satisfaction and organizational commitment, as well as on likelihood to pursue externally visible credentials, for male nurses. Analyses of data collected from 178 male nurses demonstrated that GPII significantly predicted job satisfaction and organizational commitment, and that perceived respect of nursing partially mediated this relationship. Evidence for the association between GPII and externally visible credentials was mixed, and perceived respect of nursing did not mediate this relationship. We discuss the implications of these findings for men in nursing, including the importance of perceived respect of one's occupation in formation of positive job attitudes. ¬© 2014 American Psychological Association.

2-s2.0-46149125529	2008	Gender in Management	Rural women entrepreneurship within co-operatives: Training support	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to appraise rural women entrepreneurs, running co-operatives in Greece. The paper seeks to examine the effects of training support on their entrepreneurial skills and attitudes, co-operatives' viability and growth prospects, and work-family balance. Design/methodology/approach - An evaluation research was conducted in which 104 rural women members of co-operatives, who had participated in a specific training program contributed. Anonymous questionnaires were used to collect data on participants' perceptions of the effects of the training intervention. Descriptive statistics, factor analysis and intercorellations were employed in analysing the data. Findings - The data illustrate that participants perceived benefits in terms of skill improvements, i.e. identification and capturing of business opportunities, effective co-operation and flexibility in decision making and more positive attitudes towards entrepreneurship. In addition, perceptions related to the development and growth prospects of the co-operative and to work-family balance have also been positively affected. Practical implications - The effectiveness of an entrepreneurship program can be enhanced when it is designed to meet the real needs of the organization and thus is more focused. Training needs analysis prior to intervention is a prerequisite. Moreover, achieving work-family balance can also be seen as an aspect of a co-operative's performance that can be improved through training. Originality/value - This paper enriches research on the effect of entrepreneurship training programs for rural women co-operative members.	Article	 Greece

Women, minorities, younger faculty, and those with less experience and credentials reported more incivility/bullying from students. More women (63.3%) than men (50.2%) reported a serious incident of student incivility, bullying, aggression or sexual attention during their careers. Discussion includes recommendations for faculty and administrators concerning reporting, preventing, and handling such experiences.	Article	 United States

This quantitative study investigates cyberbullying among Canadian gay and bisexual men outside of the educational setting through a cross-sectional survey. Of the 7,430 respondents, 4.6% reported cyberbullying in the past year, with younger, Aboriginal, lower-educated, lower-income respondents reporting higher odds of experiencing cyberbullying. Victimization from cyberbullying was significantly associated with experiences of antigay discrimination as well as worry about antigay prejudice. A variety of negative health outcomes were also associated with cyberbullying, including intimate partner violence and suicidality. Implications for social service providers and future research are discussed. ¬© 2019, ¬© 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.	Article	 Canada
2-s2.0-84862928015	2011	Asian Journal of Women's Studies	From larva to butterfly: Sophia in ding ling's miss sophia's diary and coco in wei hui's	Sophia and Coco are two characters in Ding Ling's Miss Sophia's Diary (1928/1995) and Wei Hui's Shanghai Baby (1999), respectively. Like a larva, Sophia, who enters society in the early twentieth century, is weak and immobile. Coco, who lives at the end of the twentieth century, is like a butterfly leading an outlandish lifestyle. The differences between Sophia and Coco reflect the achievement of official feminism, which liberated Chinese women from traditional patriarchal control in the social sense. However, gender issues for women remain unresolved. To fight against traditional patriarchy and especially challenge gender oppression in official feminism, both Sophia and Coco boldly acknowledge and pursue sexual desire. Their feminist discourses are both commendable and controversial, given their situations and the times in which they live. ¬© 2011 Asian Center for Women's Studies; Ewha Womans University Press.

2-s2.0-84892428948	2014	Journal of Middle East Women's Studies	"Toward a feminist analysis of ""impact"": Sondra Hale's legacy and Egypt's ongoing revolution"	Sondra Hale's deep and long-term relationship with Sudan has produced a substantial body of scholarship that has transformed the anthropology of gender in the Middle East. She argues in her work that a version of Islamic citizenship was articulated by Hassan al-Turabi's Islamist government in Sudan in the 1990s to shape society's notion of the ideal Muslim woman. This essay looks at Hale's work on women's citizenship in Sudan to examine the constitution of this notion and how it shapes women's citizenship in post-Arab Spring Egypt. My aims are to explore the various conflicting powers through which ideals of women's citizenship in Egypt after the revolution are produced and to problematize Hale's notion of citizenship to better understand the role that Islamism plays in shaping these gendered political subjectivities. ¬© 2013.

This article uses ethnographic data gathered in Greece, Italy, and Spain to examine pregnant migrants‚Äô experiences of crossing, first reception, and reproductive care. We discuss our findings through the conceptual lens of vulnerability, which we understand as a shifting and relational condition attributed to, or dynamically endorsed by, migrant patients within given social contexts and encounters. We focus on two principal aspects of migrant women‚Äôs experiences. First, we shed light on their profiles, their journeys to Europe via the three main Mediterranean routes, and the conditions of first reception. Through ethnographic vignettes we examine the diverse ways in which pregnant migrants become vulnerable within these contexts. Second, we turn to the reproductive healthcare they receive in EU borderlands. We explore how declinations of ideas of vulnerability shape the medical encounter between healthcare professionals and migrant women and how vulnerability is dynamically used or contested by migrant patients to engage in meaningful social relations in unpredictable and unstable borderlands. ¬© 2018, The Author(s).

Efectos sobre la relaci√≥n entre componentes]	This paper explores the relation between gender stereotyping in traits and roles and sociodemographic variables, as well as the relation between the descriptive and prescriptive characteristics of such traits and roles. In Study 1, a representative national sample of 1255 participants was used. The results showed that trait stereotyping did not vary among participants, whereas role stereotyping did vary as a function of gender (women stereotyped less) age (young people stereotyped less) and educational level (people with a high level stereotyped less). The relation between trait stereotyping (descriptive) and role stereotyping (prescriptive) is very low. Study 2 was carried out to verify mainly the relation between the prescriptive and descriptive aspects of a single component: traits. The participants were 96 professional women. In this study, a weak relation was found between the descriptive and the prescriptive aspects of trait stereotyping, and a strong relation between the prescriptive aspects of traits and roles. These results are coherent with the assumption that the descriptive and prescriptive aspects of gender stereotyping are independent. In both studies, correlations were observed indicating that people who tend to stereotype in instrumental traits also maintain more stereotyped beliefs about the prescriptive trait and role aspects. ¬© 2009 by Fundaci√≥n Infancia y Aprendizaje.

This study investigated the relation between Wholistic-Analytic and Verbal-Imagery cognitive style, gender and mathematics achievement in a sample of 190 Australian primary school students aged between 8-11 years (M = 9.77, SD = 1.05). It was hypothesised that males would outperform females in mathematics achievement tests, and that gender would interact with cognitive style on mathematics performance. A significant gender/cognitive style interaction was found. Boys with an Analytic/Imagery style achieved significantly higher results than the girls with an Analytic/Imagery style, supporting the contention that certain cognitive styles affect boys and girls mathematics performance differently. Implications of results and strategies for improving mathematics achievement among girls are discussed. ¬© 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.	Article	 Australia

Taking off from our previous findings that discrimination hindering women's economic participation originate at the level of traditions and perpetuate at the level of regulations, this article suggests a combined qualitative and quantitative methodology that addresses gender issues in the Doing Business project. The approach evaluates discrimination at the level of traditions with one of two quantitative methodological options that incorporate gender perspectives at the regulatory level.	Article	 Germany

The purpose of the study was to determine (a) what teachers know about gender equitable practices, (b) what types of gender bias are demonstrated, and (c) how teachers are influenced to adopt gender equitable behaviors in the physical education context. Method: A multiple-case study approach was used to provide an in-depth analysis of the attitudes and behaviors of four physical education teachers from four different schools. Teachers were formally and informally interviewed before, during, and after four extensive two-week periods of observations that included being audio recorded throughout the school day. Results: Themes emerged across the cases indicating that teachers engaged in teaching practices that reinforced gender stereotypes through biased language and gender segregation. Discussion/Conclusion: Teachers' lack of awareness and understanding of gender equity prevented them from providing an inclusive learning experience for all students. ¬© 2017 Human Kinetics, Inc.

2-s2.0-84912527357	2014	Urban Geography	Gender, social network geographies, and low-wage employment among recent Mexican immigrants in Los Angeles	This article explores gender differences in the characteristics, spatiality, and capacities of local social networks and their impacts on the employment of recent Mexican immigrants to Los Angeles. After describing the institutional landscape of the regional labor market that new entrants must navigate to find work, I turn to unique and detailed data from a randomized household survey of Mexican immigrants in Los Angeles County. I analyze the role of friends, family members, and neighbors in shaping occupational segregation and hourly earnings of those who migrated to the region during the preceding 5 years. Results suggest that local social networks operate differently for men and women and tend to reinforce differences in mobility and employment. This research contributes both empirically and theoretically to literature on immigrant economic integration by showing how uneven urban labor markets are constituted spatially through gendered networks that connect workers differently to homes, communities, and work places. ¬© 2014 Taylor & Francis.

2-s2.0-84947129851	2015	International Feminist Journal of Politics	Northern Crises: Women's Relationships and Resistances to Resource Extractions	"Using feminist disability studies and intersectionality, this article draws upon the ongoing resource extractions in Labrador, Canada to argue for examining local communities and relationships as one way to understand gender and global social, economic and environmental crises. The article explores how crises in Labrador have been constituted and maintained around global agendas of economic and resource development, historical and current colonial practices and a limited and constrained international relations with local Indigenous nations. The lives of women and their communities in Labrador illustrate one wave of a global crisis that extinguishes diversity and connection to the land in a race to extract natural resources, maintain global military power and gain profit in the global economy. The actions over the past thirty years by NATO and the Canadian federal, provincial and municipal governments, coupled with transnational mining corporations such as Vale, have ""normalized"" crisis in the communities and reduced the capacity of these communities and Indigenous nations to respond to the issues arising as a result of the Muskrat Falls hydroelectric development project. Yet the women and their communities illustrate their agency and reject an analysis of them exclusively as victims. Together with researchers and activists, the women in Labrador have built a community of practice in the Feminist Northern Network. ¬© 2015 Taylor and Francis."	Article	 Canada

Sister friends can be crucial in assisting African American women and women of ethnically diverse backgrounds to face, address, and overcome, major transitions including stress and traumatic stress. Through a reflection and analysis of the relationship with a sister friend, the author explores the strength and challenges of sister friendship as well as therapeutic value. Recommendations are provided for sisterhood as a clinical intervention as well as for women therapist's self care. A case study of an African American woman in need of mutual sister friends is summarized. This exploration is shared through a womanistic psychology. ¬© 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

It focuses specifically on strategies HIV-positive men use to manage emotional vulnerability in sexual encounters. We identify a core theme of ""splitting,"" in which men compartmentalize the domains of sexuality and emotional intimacy. We examine how this aspect of masculinity is at times exacerbated as a strategy to minimize emotional investment in sexual partners. By splitting the emotional and sexual domains, the men are able to perform sexually with casual sex partners while minimizing both the risk of infecting intimate partners and a fear of rejection from those they care about or desire most. However, the tensions created by splitting the emotional and sexual domains may disintegrate intimate interpersonal relationships that serve as a base of much-needed emotional support. ¬© 2006 Sage Publications."

2-s2.0-85027929888	2015	IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management	Gender Biases in Hiring Project Managers: Perceptions of Trust and Likeability	There have been numerous studies examining the effects of social role theory on negative stereotyping of female managers, including low perceived likeability and unwillingness by subordinates to trust them. These attributions are particularly relevant in the context of 'male-dominated' jobs, such as technical disciplines like engineering and project management. We investigated the specific setting of project manager job candidate selection, a professional discipline that has historically been male-dominated, but one that has seen a large rise in female project managers over the past decade. We examined the perceptions of respondents to differences in male and female job candidates based on the critical personal/managerial characteristics of trust and likeability. Using a scenario-based survey questionnaire, we sampled 312 project management personnel and tested subjects' reactions to two candidates for a project management position, employing identical descriptions and language while only changing the candidate's name: Susan or Stan. Our results suggested that, contrary to expectations, respondents' perceptions of the female candidate, Susan, were significantly higher across both managerial dimensions of likeability and trust. Implications of these findings and directions for future research are discussed. ¬© 1988-2012 IEEE.	Article	 United States
2-s2.0-85037682694	2018	International Review of Financial Analysis	Audit committee financial expertise, gender, and earnings management: Does gender of the financial expert matter?	The effectiveness of the presence of financial expertise on the audit committee (AC) in reducing earnings management has been the subject of many previous studies with mixed findings. This paper suggests that the mixed findings may be due to prior studies not distinguishing between the genders of the financial experts on the AC. We investigate how financial expertise affects earnings management taking into account the gender of the financial expert. We use the data of a sample of 5660 US firm-year observations from 2007 to 2013 which was analysed using least squares regressions clustering by firm. The results indicate that proportion of financial expertise on the AC and gender reduces earnings management. We then group the AC financial experts by gender, and examine whether the gender of the financial expert matters. The results show that the proportion of female financial experts on the AC is significantly associated with less earnings management while the proportion of male financial experts does not significantly affect earnings management; this suggests that previous studies indicating that the presence of a financial expert on the AC may have been influenced by gender of the female financial experts. Further, our findings may also partly explain the contradictory findings of prior studies on the effect of financial expertise on the ACs effectivness. ¬© 2017 Elsevier Inc.	Article	 United Kingdom

Participants were 407 pregnant women who were admitted to 7 WO programs and 29 MG programs in 13 counties across California during 2000-2002. Pregnant women treated in WO programs demonstrated greater severity in drug use, legal problems, and psychiatric problems than those treated in the MG programs. They were also less likely to be employed and more likely to be homeless. Women-only programs were more likely to offer child care, children's psychological services, and HIV testing. The greater problem severity of pregnant women treated in WO programs suggests that these specialized services are filling an important gap in addiction services, although further expansion is warranted in psychiatric, legal, and employment services. ¬© 2006 National Council for Community Behavioral Healthcare.

2-s2.0-18344393794	2005	Journal of Criminal Justice	Gender equity, traditional masculine culture, and female homicide victimization	Several prior studies of gender equity and female violent victimization showed a positive relationship between the two, with some scholars defining this as a backlash effect due to increasing gender equity in the context of conservative gender role expectations. This assertion was tested here under a more general set of theories about real and perceived threats to White male dominance in the United States that suggested that the positive relationship between gender equity and female victimization was conditioned by the strength of traditional masculine culture. Using cross-sectional data and employing a commonly tested baseline model to control for other structural covariates of homicide rates, variables were introduced to represent gender income equity and different components of traditional masculine culture. Results confirmed a positive cross-sectional relationship between gender income equality and White non-Hispanic female homicide victimization rates, but did not show the expected interaction effects, leading the authors to conclude that other structural or cultural factors were the source of the positive relationship. ¬© 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

2-s2.0-85015670199	2017	Ethical Theory and Moral Practice	Home Economics for Gender Justice? A Case for Gender-Differentiated Caregiving Education	Recent calls for reinstituting mandatory home economics education have emphasized its potential to advance gender egalitarian aims. The thought is that, because women‚Äôs disproportionate performance of caregiving and household labor is partially caused by gender socialization that better prepares women than men for such work, we can disrupt gender inegalitarian work distributions by preparing everyone for the sort of work in question. The curricula envisioned in these calls are gender-neutral, in the sense that they recommend identical educational interventions for all genders. By exploiting a parallel between gender-neutral educational policies and gender-neutral family leave policies, we argue first that gender-neutral home economics instruction is unlikely to advance gender egalitarian aims, and may in fact reinforce the very outcomes it is meant to disrupt. However, we further argue that a more radical home economics curriculum could avoid these difficulties. To the extent that we value educational interventions as a possible means for advancing gender egalitarian aims, we have good reason to seriously consider adopting a gender non-neutral program in which all and only boys receive mandatory caregiving instruction. ¬© 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

2-s2.0-85052661183	2019	Gender, Work and Organization	New managerialism in the academy: Gender bias and precarity	In the era of global competition, academic institutions are increasingly being managed as efficient organizations where early career academics are the most vulnerable group in the academic hierarchy. We use gender budgeting to deconstruct the financial and managerial processes and procedures in a selected academic institution in Iceland. Drawing on multiple data collection methods, we argue that new managerialism enhances the precarious position of early career academics, especially women and those in the more feminized fields. Furthermore, we show that the system's bias in favour of so-called hard science generates gendered consequences for early career academics. We demonstrate this structural gender bias in each of the first three stages of an academic career: PhD, postdoc and other temporary positions, and assistant professorship. By highlighting the gendered consequences of new managerialism, we want to direct attention to the need to include a gender perspective in the budgeting and all the decision-making processes in academic institutions. ¬© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd	Article	 Switzerland
2-s2.0-84922410226	2015	Gender, Place and Culture	Political dynamics of the post-communist Montenegro: one-party show	Montenegro is the only European post-communist country governed by the same party ‚Äì the Democratic Party of Socialists ‚Äì since the introduction of political pluralism. Thought-provoking as such, this appears even more puzzling in light of the radical transformation that the party underwent during this period. Once the pillar of the Montenegrin hybrid regime, the DPS played the key role in the country's democratization, subsequent to the 1997 split within its leadership. Moreover, being the most vocal advocate of a state federation with Serbia for more than a decade, it became the main political force behind the renewal of Montenegrin independence. This article seeks to contribute to a better understanding of this unique and understudied post-communist political phenomenon. It argues that the DPS's longevity in power has been determined by two factors. In the earlier non-democratic governing phase, it was the considerably high level of the party's institutionalization that brought about its political supremacy. In the following period, the party managed to monopolize the idea of Montenegrin sovereignty, thus acquiring a significant amount of political legitimacy. The article uses the explaining outcome process tracing method that attempts to craft a minimally sufficient explanation of an outcome by combining theoretical and case-specific mechanisms. ¬© 2013 Taylor & Francis.

2-s2.0-84897663671	2013	Journal of Men's Studies	Men against the wall: Graffiti(ed) masculinities	This paper invokes the categories of the masculine that have been discursively constructed in the historical and social context of hip hop and graffiti culture. The production and performance of graffiti(ed) masculinities are the result of a complex mix that samples notions of class, race, violence, space, commodification, gender, resistance, and violence. Graffiti culture embodies the colonizer's ideals of a masculinity that is dangerous, aggressive and takes risks, while giving men a medium with which to tell their stories and allowing them to express their emotions. The article argues that graffiti(ed) masculinities are composed of seemingly disparate and complex components that shadow the masculine ideals of the colonizer, of hegemonic masculinity, as well as borrowing from notions of subordinate and resistive masculinities. ¬© 2013 by the Men's Studies Press, LLC.

2-s2.0-84874511466	2012	Psychology of Men and Masculinity	"Show me the data! Empirical support for the ""centerfold syndrome"""	Concern about depictions of objectified females in the media has been longstanding. Research on the effects of such depictions on males has been undertheorized, however, as most theorizing has focused on outcomes related to sexual aggression. One scholar has developed a detailed theory of how heterosexual males are affected by objectifying portrayals of females in the media: Gary Brooks. The purpose of this article was to assess Brooks' claims for empirical support, because his theory has been criticized as anecdotal and unsubstantiated (Barbee, 1998). Although Brooks relies very little on social scientific data to generate his arguments, the relevant quantitative literature is largely in alignment with his media-related assertions. Certain components of Brooks' theory are more supported than others, though. Critiques of the applicable literature are provided and directions for future research are derived from these appraisals. ¬© 2011 American Psychological Association.	Article	 United States
2-s2.0-85056657574	2018	Men and Masculinities	Is ‚ÄúHegemonic Masculinity‚Äù Hegemonic as Masculinity? Two Israeli Case Studies	In this article, we consider Connell‚Äôs theory of masculinity through a phenomenon we encountered in our respective research projects, one focusing on the construction of masculinity among early Zionist ideological workers and the other focusing on present-day military masculinities and ethnicity in Israel. In both contexts, a bodily performance which marks the breach of ‚Äúcivilized behavior‚Äù is adopted in order to signify accentuated masculinity. In both, a symbolic hierarchy of masculinities emerges, in which Arabs‚Äîand in the case of Golani soldiers, also ‚ÄúArab Jews,‚Äù that is, Jews who descended from Arab countries‚Äîare marked as more masculine than hegemonic Ashkenazi men (i.e., men of European descent). Thus, while our case studies support Connell‚Äôs argument that masculinity may be practiced in various ways, the hierarchical relationship between masculine styles appears to be more multilayered than Connell‚Äôs theory suggests. We connect the tension between masculine status, understood as a location within a symbolic hierarchy of masculinities, and social status in our case studies to the contradiction at the heart of modern masculinity. We argue that in order to account for this tension, which may arise in specific interactional contexts, we need a concept of masculinity as a cultural repertoire, of which people make situated selections. The repertoire of masculinity is where the elements and models that organize both masculine practice and perceptions concerning masculinity are stored. While selections from the repertoire of masculinity cannot be conceived as voluntary, the conventional nature of cultural repertoires allows for some leeway in the selections that people make. Hence, it allows for a more flexible relationship between social positions and masculine styles. ¬© The Author(s) 2017.	Article	 Israel

Children (abuse survivors and others), parents, men and women from the community and a range of key informants (such as police, social workers, health workers, NGO staff and teachers) were asked about their experiences and perceptions of child rape and child rearing.

Drawing on the data, we reflect on aspects of the social context of child rape in South Africa and Namibia that at least provide space for, without actually legitimating, these acts. We argue that children are rendered vulnerable to abuse because of a series of ideas which create opportunities, the most important of which is the dominant patriarchal ideology, compounded by the pronounced age hierarchies found in these societies. The high status of men, with respect to particularly girl children, leads to vulnerability through reducing girls' ability to refuse sexual advances and generating expectations in men that they should control women and children. Rape is often an act of punishment, used to demonstrate power over girl children and manufacture control. Rape is also used as an instrument of communication with oneself (the rapist) about masculinity and powerfulness. This ability to avoid being caught was important in some rapes. Some children are rendered vulnerable by coming from backgrounds where the likelihood of cases being pursued was low. Whilst it is often said that communities abhor child rape, responses to cases show that often strong action is not taken against perpetrators and the girls may be equally, or predominantly, blamed. In cases close to home, perpetrators are often protected. Thus the dominant message is that much as child rape is abhorred, responses are highly inadequate. Advances in gender equity are central to positive change. ¬© 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	Article	 H.
2-s2.0-84875814398	2013	World Development	From Nutrition to Aspirations and Self-Efficacy: Gender Bias over Time among Children in Four Countries	"We use data on children at ages 8, 12, and 15 from Young Lives, a cohort study of 12,000 children across Ethiopia, India (Andhra Pradesh), Peru, and Vietnam to document the presence of a gender gap across indicators of nutrition, education, aspirations, subjective well-being, and psychosocial competencies. We find considerable heterogeneity across countries, ages, and indicators in the existence and direction of gender gaps. Second, we find evidence of an ""institutionalized"" gender bias against girls in education in India and, to an extent, Ethiopia.

2-s2.0-33744979504	2006	Quality Management in Health Care	"Physician gender and primary care patient satisfaction: No evidence of ""feminization"""	"BACKGROUND: Observers predict that the influx of women into the medical profession will alter the way in which medicine is practiced, incorporating more ""feminine"" values of caring, listening to patients, and patient centeredness, in contrast to the ""masculine"" values of curing, dictating to patients, and care provider centeredness. Consequently, patient satisfaction with medical care will improve. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Retrospective database analysis of satisfaction survey data. A total of 3985 surveys from primary care patients were examined after having identified the gender of the patient's physician. Ten survey items that pertained to physician attributes were analyzed, individually and in the aggregate, in a series of 2 √ó 2 analyses of covariance, with physician gender and patient gender serving as independent variables, and patient age and the overall level of patient satisfaction from the physician's facility serving as covariates. An additional analysis of covariance, with the same independent variables and covariates, examined patients expressed likelihood of recommending their physician to others. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: There were no main or interaction effects for physician gender or patient gender after adjusting for patient age and facility-level satisfaction. The implications of these results for the ""feminization"" hypothesis are discussed. ¬© 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc."	Article	 United States
2-s2.0-84917689712	2014	Mediterranean Journal of Social Sciences	Exploring university students‚Äô gender role attitudes and their effects on sexuality and behaviour towards hiv/aids prevention: A case study	The paper investigated the effects of gender attitudes and the extent to which they impact on the sexuality of third year Bachelor Degree students in a Zimbabwean university. The goal of the study was to establish their level of awareness to the existing HIV/AIDS preventive measures. The study used a total sample size of 80 participants selected from four faculties in the university through the gender stratified random sampling technique. The design adopted was a quantitative case study and data were elicited by means of questionnaires, focus group interviews and observations of co-curricular activities. The analysis of findings followed the use of descriptive and inferential statistics, with statistical models such as the chi-square test of significance being adopted to establish the students‚Äô differential gender attitudes towards sexuality and awareness to the existence of HIV/AIDS preventive measures. The major findings indicated that the students‚Äô attitudes towards sexuality were gender based while their awareness to HIV/AIDS preventive strategies was mainly influenced by gender stereotypes and cultural beliefs about femininity and masculinity. The study concluded that there is an imperative need for social structures to help deconstruct the gender biases, stigmas, stereotypes and prejudices that render girls and women vulnerable. This can be done through the use of gender neutral discourses and advocacy activities by their lecturers, parents, teachers as significant others in their society. ¬© 2014, Mediterranean Center of Social and Educational Research.

Our aim is to analyse the social relations that shape the kinds of places recently arrived migrant women experience as 'safe', as well as their everyday experiences of inclusion and exclusion. The use of photography - wherein the women choose how, when and where to shoot photos - helps us highlight what otherwise would not be immediately evident with regard to the experience of such places. We argue that there are inclusive places in segregated spaces, and that issues of ethnic inclusion and exclusion are linked to ethnic hegemony and other relationships of power. Drawing on theories of relational space in general, and transgressive space in particular, we demonstrate that our informants' daily existence is simultaneously integrated and segregated, included and excluded, and that emancipatory processes that are already under way must be allowed to proceed if the social landscape of integration is to be an open and equal one. ¬© 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

The participants were 150 voluntary sportsmen, (67 children and 83 girls). There were realized a total of 230 RPE's records among all the played parties. For the record of the RPE there was in use the pictorial scale of Eston and Parfitt (2007). The height (cm) was calculated using by a tallimeter and the body mass with body mass scale, both of the model IT DRIES? (Germany); the (BMI) was calculated from the measurements of height and weight. One developed a descriptive study and inferences of the RPE of the party depending on the gender and the (BMI). A logistic regression multinomial model was implemented, the odds ratio was calculated and the intervals of confidence to 95 % to establish the degree of association between the RPE and the variables that have been an object of study. The results described that the boys presented an average height of 152,67 7,94 cm and a body mass of 43,7 - 5,96 kg and for the girls 154,76 7,72 cm of height and 43,7 7,14 kg of body mass. With regard to the perception of the effort, RPE's average observed was 4,41 1,61, placing the trend of the average values of every period between RPE = 4 and RPE = 5, with a standard deviation between 1,60 and 1,95. Significant differences were not observed depending on the kind, though the girls present a RPE lightly superior to that of the boys.	Article	 Spain

Based on the 1990-92 pension reforms and the political debate preceding them, the article argues that the government had a confused understanding of gender equality, resulting in a selective application of the concept that was hardly in women's interests. Two factors may account for the marginalisation of gender during this debate: first, the initial definition of the pension problem that was blind co gender inequalities within the system, and second, the lack of an organised mechanism to protect and promote women's financial independence and right of choice in the pension system. ¬© The Policy Press, 2007.

2-s2.0-85063536792	2019	Information Communication and Society	Social support networks, instant messaging, and gender equity in refugee education	This paper addresses the role of instant messaging chat groups to support teacher training and gender equity initiatives in Kenyan refugee camps. Our findings are based on survey data with refugee teachers in Dadaab and Kakuma refugee camps (n = 203), group interviews with refugee teachers in Kakuma (n = 21), and interviews with international instructors of teacher training programs in Nairobi, Toronto, and Vancouver (n = 14). In our analysis, we apply amplification theory, feminist science and technology studies paradigms, and considerations of transnational approaches to understand the use of instant messaging among refugee teacher communities. Our framework explores how social and cultural norms are amplified through transnational text and instant messaging related to teacher training and in support of gender equity. Peer-to-peer group chats draw on transnational learning opportunities and expand these engagements through group chats between men and women refugee teachers across camps as well as through community engagement about gender equity initiatives in education. International instructors identify both value and hesitation in navigating the quantity and content of these communications, such as learning more about refugee teachers‚Äô daily lives in the camps and concern about following and managing the amount of communication that can ensue over chat groups. Our work has practical implications for transnational teacher training programs in refugee camps, illuminates how mobile technology and chat groups allow women and men in the community to engage and support girls‚Äô education, and questions how text messaging affects the lived and day-to-day experiences of women refugee teachers. ¬© 2019, ¬© 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

The study focused on four variables: gender, race, experience, and provenance; and analyzed variations across faculty and university types. The findings show that the great majority of Canadian university deans possess a Canadian background, with half of them being recruited internally, and that proportions of non-White and female deans mostly align with those of the professoriate. However, the study reveals a pattern of upward cumulative attrition suggesting that structural barriers to success, perseverance, and promotion are shaping non-White and female deans' career paths. Finally, data suggest that about 40% of Canadian university deans are reappointed for a second term. ¬© 2019, ¬© 2019 Society for Research into Higher Education.	Article	 Canada
2-s2.0-84855744244	2012	International Journal of Entrepreneurial Behaviour & Research	Gender and business ownership: Questioning ‚Äúwhat‚Äù and ‚Äúwhy‚Äù	To date, comparisons of performance in male and female businesses show contradictory results, although the majority of evidence is drawn from Anglo-Saxon countries. This study aims to explore the effects of gender on business performance in a sample of Spanish firms. This paper extends previous work with a quantitative analysis of effects of gender on performance. In-depth interviews yield insights on how gender impacts performance. The quantitative analysis shows that gender has a simple effect on performance, but it is less robust when other factors are included in the model. Furthermore, this relationship is more complex, since gender has an indirect and moderating effect on performance. The results indicate possible sources of gender differences and suggest factors that require further investigation with a qualitative approach. This analysis expands our understanding in two ways: first, by suggesting that we have to make sense of businesses through another lens, and second, by implying that we have to be aware that we can find heterogeneity among women. Performance differences are due to differences in women's assessment of performance and/or their socio-economic positioning. The premises of mainstream theories should be questioned in order to develop gender research. The study answers the call of using mixed methods to gain insights that lead to a cumulative knowledge in this area. ¬© 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited	Article	 United States
2-s2.0-84866309387	2012	Hawwa	Wandering about as she pleases: Prostitutes, adolescent girls, and female slaves in cairo's public space, 1850-1882	"Abstract This paper examines how women who ""wandered about"" public spaces were perceived in police and court records of Khedival Egypt, in the period from 1850-1882. In the context of growing cities, rural immigration and manumission of slaves, the Egyptian authorities sought to monitor the urban streets and clear them of ""undesirables."" Such control measures, this paper argues, were dictated by gender. By examining cases involving runaway and manumitted slaves, adolescent girls and prostitutes, as well as official laws and regulations, this article shows how the mobility and visibility of women in public spaces was regulated and controlled. While male unregulated presence in the streets was deemed to be a security concern in very limited circumstances, the unsupervised presence of women outside of the fold of family or community connoted sexual misconduct. Where young girls went, whom prostitutes interacted with, what women chose to wear, and what black women were doing outdoors-all of these were becoming state concerns. ¬© 2012 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden."

2-s2.0-79957999223	2011	Biology of Sex Differences	Effects of a selectively bred novelty-seeking phenotype on the motivation to take cocaine in male and female rats	Background: Gender and enhanced novelty reactivity can predispose certain individuals to drug abuse. Previous research in male and female rats selectively bred for high or low locomotor reactivity to novelty found that bred High Responders (bHRs) acquire cocaine self-administration more rapidly than bred Low Responders (bLRs) and that bHR females in particular self-administered more cocaine than the other groups. The experiments presented here aimed to determine whether an individual's sex and behavioral phenotype interact to affect motivation to take cocaine. Methods: We examined motivation for taking cocaine in two experiments using a range of doses on a progressive ratio (PR) schedule of responding in bHR or bLR males and females. Additionally, we included a measure of continuing to respond in the absence of reinforcement, a feature of addiction that has been recently incorporated into tests of animal models on the basis of the criteria for substance use disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition. Statistical analyses were performed using PASW Statistics 18.0 software. Data were analyzed using repeated-measures analysis of variance followed by a Bonferroni correction post hoc test when applicable. Results: We found sex differences as well as effects of novelty reactivity on the motivation to self-administer cocaine. Specifically, females demonstrated higher breaking points on the PR schedule compared with males, regardless of phenotype, and bHR males and females exhibited higher motivation than bLR animals at a number of the doses studied. Conclusions: An individual's sex continues to be a predisposing factor with respect to drug abuse liability and can be compounded by additional individual differences such as reactivity to novelty. ¬© 2011 Cummings et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

2-s2.0-37249092683	2008	Feminist Economics	Poland's transition and new opportunities for women	Since 1990, marketization has fundamentally altered Poland's economy. Like many former Soviet bloc countries, Polish prices, wages, and foreign trade have been liberalized, and many state assets are now privatized. Independent central banks, commercial banking systems, and stock exchanges have been formed, and the taxation and legal systems have been restructured to support a market economy. The dominant view is that this process should benefit most Poles over time. For Polish women, however, the first phase of economic transition was a mixed blessing. This paper explores their experiences in between 1990 and 2003 and discusses two positive, mutually supportive ways that Polish women have benefited during transition: First, the segmentation of the labor market has positioned women advantageously in the country's key financial sector and entrepreneurial ranks. Second, women have benefited from the growth of a women's movement. Together, these two processes can be expected to accelerate the pace of positive changes for Polish women.	Article	 United States

This discussion necessitates a further look at semantic assignment rules that have nothing to do with the semantic core for gender. Such non-core rules are referred to as ""crazy"" here. Evidence for non-core rules is presented, and the paper presents criteria for distinguishing between plausible and implausible such rules. Some rules that have been proposed in the literature clearly fall short of the criteria. Other 'crazy' rules fare better. The paper also presents a scenario for the origin of crazy rules and discusses what they tell us about gender and about the nature of linguistic generalisations, which can be quite ""local"". ¬© 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In-depth interviews with 22 well-characterized autistic gender-diverse adolescents revealed critical themes, including: recollections of pre-pubertal gender nonconformity; vivid experiences of gender dysphoria; a fear of social gender expression due to perceived animosity toward transgender people; and specific challenges that result from the interplay of gender diversity and neurodiversity. During the ~ 22 month study social gender affirmation increased in six participants and gender dysphoria attenuated in four participants.

A systematic literature review was conducted to look into the relationship between youngsters‚Äô GRA and individual, home, and school characteristics. Thirty-five international studies were identified through searches in different databases. The review reveals that the studies mostly apply a deterministic view to studying the construction of GRA, focusing predominantly on parent‚Äìchild transmission. Effects of the school environment and individuals‚Äô own life experiences are under-studied. Also, data are mostly cross-sectional and leave little room for investigating evolutions of GRA over time. Suggestions for future research are formulated focusing on (a) a life-course approach that considers GRA as situated, experience-related, and therefore changing over time and (b) an intersectionality-informed approach investigating GRA at the intersects of multiple diversity dimensions. ¬© 2016, ¬© The Author(s) 2016.

In the present study, we investigate the role of gender norms in determining the interpretation of events and the degree of social support given to victims. Thirtyeight survivors from the Kosovo conflict in 1999 were interviewed and data was analyzed using thematic and content analysis. The findings suggest that events which are seen as affirming gender norms (such as men who were injured in fighting the enemy) evoke pride in the victim and support from the community whereas events that are seen as undermining gender norms (such as women who are sexually assaulted) evoke shame in the victim and rejection by the community. Women, we suggest, are psychologically vulnerable both because they are more likely than men to experience identity undermining events and also because the consequences of such events are more severe for women than men. ¬© 2014 American Psychological Association.

The results of empirical testing demonstrate three distinct components of online shopping attitude and significant gender differences in all three attitudinal components. The results also show that the largest gender difference is in the cognitive attitude, indicating that females value the utility of online shopping less than their male counterparts do. ¬© 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

2-s2.0-70350496633	2009	Violence Against Women	Intimate partner violence and social isolation across the rural/urban divide	Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a pervasive social problem that affects victims, families, and communities. Beginning with the acknowledgment of this phenomenon as a social problem, investigations have attempted to answer questions regarding the extent, prevalence, and the possible contributing social and psychological factors that influence this behavior. This study proposes an approach to the problem of IPV based on a unifying concept: social isolation. The authors argue that the utility of the concept of social isolation lies in its ability to encapsulate critical social-structural and social-psychological correlates of IPV. The main objective of the study is to examine the extent to which the role of social isolation in predicting IPV varies by urban/rural context. Measures of key variables were obtained from Waves 1 and 2 of the National Survey of Families and Households and the 1990 census. Results of multivariate analyses indicate that only some measures of social support (isolation) are statistically significant and only for families within rural (nonmetropolitan) counties. ¬© The Author(s) 2009.

Multivariate analyses revealed that eight gender-neutral risk factors-assessed via the Level of Service/Case Management Inventory (LS/CMI)-performed very well in the prediction of the general and violent recidivism of more than 400 adult female offenders. None of the gender-specific factors, including parenting responsibility and stress, victimization history, and self-harm, had incremental validity over the gender-neutral risk and need variables. However, financial problems and a measure of personal misfortune did predict reoffending among low-risk/low-need women. The findings suggest that risk factors derived from a gender-neutral social cognitive theory of crime are relevant for adult females and that perhaps gender-specific concerns may be best viewed as specific responsivity factors. ¬© 2010 International Association for Correctional and Forensic Psychology.

2-s2.0-79952660186	2011	Economics of Transition	When does transition increase the gender wage gap?: An application to Belarus Pastore and Verashchagina The Gender Wage Gap during Transition	In the context of underlying stability in female participation rates, the gender wagegap, measured by the log of monthly wages, more than doubled in Belarus from 1996 to 2006. In this respect, the country has experienced a variant of the transition which occurred in the former Soviet Union where relative female wages fell by more than female participation. We have used the Machado and Mata (2005) analysis of the gender gap distribution. This reveals that the effect of coefficients on observed characteristics in widening the gap was increasing over time, especially in the lower and middle deciles of the wage distribution. At the same time, the effect of the characteristics themselves in reducing the gap was shrinking. The decomposition of changes in the gap over time, based on Juhn (1991), confirms that the contraction of women's relative wages has been caused both by a deterioration in the observed characteristics of female workers and by the associated remuneration. Changes in the residual wage distribution tend to slightly reduce the gap rather than, as is the case elsewhere, to increase it. The analysis carried out in line with Neuman and Oaxaca (2004) suggests that the increased gap was not caused by sample selection. Instead, two observed factors are found to be mainly responsible for the results: hours of work have increased for men more than for women and women have experienced segregation in low-wage industries. ¬© 2011 The Authors.

A growing body of comparative research on women's substantive representation provides insights into the kinds of policy topics that are often categorized as women's issues, as well as the personal backgrounds of the legislators who represent women's interests. We raise and analyze three key questions: Can only female legislators represent women's interests? How does a legislator's sex/gender interact with other factors such as partisanship in shaping who represents women's interests and how? How do contextual factors such as party systems impact how women's substantive representation occurs? We explore these questions in the context of the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly and the Seoul Metropolitan Council using an in-depth examination of statements made by local council members in plenary and committee sessions (Tokyo 2009-2015 and Seoul 2009-2014). We found that similar issues are discussed as being relevant to women in the two local councils. However, the issues emphasized and where those issues are discussed vary across our cases. Female members, regardless of their party affiliation, address women's issues more often than their male counterparts in both countries, although female members of progressive parties tend to advocate for women more actively, and parties representing distinct constituencies and ideologies highlight different aspects of women's concerns. Our findings contribute to existing knowledge of women's substantive representation, as well as to research on women and politics in the Asian region.	Article	 Japan

It discusses how the Indian laws, the courts, and women try to deal with the difficulties and problems relating to issues of abuse, abandonment, and violence. It also highlights the inadequacies in laws and policies relating to such marriages in India. This article is complimentary to the article by Ann Stewart that concentrates on the ""receiving"" end of transnational marriages in the United Kingdom, and focuses on the ways in which the socio-legal context of the receiving State (in this case, the United Kingdom) presents difficulties for South Asian women. This article, conversely, takes a ""sending"" perspective, that is, the response of the home state, India, to the difficulties faced by Indian women involved in transnational marriages. ¬© The Author(s) 2013."

2-s2.0-28244476424	2005	Gender, Work and Organization	Public sector reform and women's work in poland: 'Working for juice, coffee and cheap cosmetics!'	The debate on the transformation of work in east central Europe has concentrated on the restructuring of employment in manufacturing to the detriment of any discussion of the transformation of work in the service and public sectors, where the majority of women are employed. Moreover, while it is frequently recognized that women have been hit hard by job loss and unemployment, less attention has been paid the changing experiences of women in work. This article looks at the profound impact of market-driven reforms in the Polish health and education sectors implemented in the late 1990s, and considers their implications for women and their work. It reports on interviews with a cross-section of women workers in schools and hospitals and with trade union leaders at both the national and branch level. The impacts of the reforms and the experiences of women workers are discussed through the themes of changing employment levels, the restructuring of working conditions, job security, wages, training, and the double burden of balancing domestic and work lives. The general findings are that although the impact has been highly uneven between workplaces and regions, in general women have experienced an intensification of work and deteriorating working conditions. Their personal lives are not only more stressful due to the pressure at work, but also the double burden of paid and domestic work has increased due to the marketization of public provision. In both sectors, the response to reform has been widespread and militant industrial action, which has gained considerable political attention. We therefore also focus on how women have contested change, both passively and actively, through trade unionism and other political practice. ¬© Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.	Article	 J.
2-s2.0-84946593326	2016	Feminist Economics	Gender Disparity in Access to the Rwandan Mutual Health Insurance Scheme	While there is a body of research on the gendered penalties of user fees within health systems in low-income countries, what is less well understood is the gendered experience of community-based health insurance (CBI) programs, which have replaced user fees for basic healthcare. This study examines the uptake of a Rwandan CBI scheme five years after the program was scaled up nationwide. Using the Enquete Int√©grale sur les Conditions de Vie des m√©nages de Rwanda (EICV2) for 2005‚Äì6, the study finds evidence that members of female-headed households are less likely than those of male-headed households to be enrolled in the CBI program. Additionally, it finds strikingly different patterns of equity effects of CBI by gender of household head by examining consumption income and wealth. These findings suggest the need for greater attention to equity, particularly gender equity, concerning the way in which voluntary CBI programs are initially implemented and evaluated. ¬© 2015 IAFFE.

2-s2.0-33845936055	2006	Journal of Women and Aging	Treatment decision-making among older women with breast cancer	This study examined breast cancer treatment decisionmaking among older adults, including professional and lay involvement. Thirty respondents were interviewed for this study; cancer survivors (70%) and newly diagnosed (30%) women with breast cancer. Respondents reported making treatment decisions in consultation with their oncologists. However, women differed on the extent to which they perceived their participation in the treatment process. Respondents' oncologists appear to be the primary factor associated with older women's breast cancer surveillance decision-making and adherence. The influence of women's support systems on their treatment decisions and surveillance activities appears to be minimal. Informal support systems, however, likely enhance women's ability to be active participants in their care. The growing need for interventions which target older women has been indicated. Interventions, however, cannot be adequately developed without first identifying the physical and psychosocial phenomena which affect decision-making. Copyright ¬© by The Haworth Press, Inc.

Improving this competence involves developing self-assessment skills that help students to analyze their own performance. However, more research is needed on the factors affecting self-assessment of the oral presentation competence, such as the speaker's confidence and the summative use of self-assessment that can act as a sort of incentive for students. A study with 201 students was carried out, focusing on a segmentation analysis and differentiating by gender and level of performance on the assessed competence. Results show that: (1) the existence of incentives is the only variable that significantly influences men's self-assessment, whereas women's self-assessment is basically conditioned by their confidence as speakers; and (2) the self-assessment of the worst speakers, rated by teachers, is influenced only by the existence of incentives, whereas the best speakers give themselves higher scores when they feel confident about speaking in public. ¬© 2018 Elsevier Ltd	Article	 Spain

In this randomized clinical trial, 183 women with osteoporosis were treated with pharmacotherapy and weight-bearing and balance-training exercises. The case group additionally performed back extensor exercises at home. Patients filled out the Persian version of the Short Form (SF-36) QOL questionnaire at baseline and 6 months post treatment. At the end, all physical and mental parameters of the SF-36 questionnaire improved significantly in the case group, except for one subscale of mental health, compared to the control group. In the control group, only some physical health dimensions (bodily pain, role limitation, physical function, vitality), and mental health status as a mental health subscale improved. In conclusion, considering a major impact of back extensor exercises on improving QOL in women with osteoporosis over the long term, these exercises should be prescribed in routine management of these patients. ¬© 2017 Taylor & Francis.

2-s2.0-85015099915	2017	Biodemography and Social Biology	Gender and Health Behavior Clustering among U.S. Young Adults	U.S. trends in population health suggest alarming disparities among young adults, who are less healthy across most measureable domains than their counterparts in other high-income countries; these international comparisons are particularly troubling for women. To deepen our understanding of gender disparities in health and underlying behavioral contributions, we document gender-specific clusters of health behavior among U.S. young adults using nationally representative data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. We find high levels of poor health behavior, but especially among men; 40 percent of men clustered into a group characterized by unhealthy behavior (e.g., poor diet, no exercise, substance use), compared to only 22 percent of women. Additionally, women tend to age out of unhealthy behaviors in young adulthood more than men. Further, we uncover gender differences in the extent to which sociodemographic position and adolescent contexts inform health behavior clustering. For example, college education was more protective for men, whereas marital status was equally protective across gender. Parental drinking mattered for health behavior clustering among men, whereas peer drinking mattered for clustering among women. We discuss these results in the context of declining female advantage in U.S. health and changing young adult social and health contexts. ¬© 2017 Society for Biodemography and Social Biology.

2-s2.0-85059641812	2019	Gender and Society	Diverging by Gender: Syrian Refugees‚Äô Divisions of Labor and Formation of Human Capital in the United States	In this article, I examine how Syrian refugee men and women shifted their household divisions of labor in their initial years of resettlement in the United States. I combine and extend relational approaches from gender theory and economic sociology to examine how men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs behaviors shifted, the resources engendered by behavioral shifts, and how they interpreted and compensated for new behaviors and resources. I show that shifts in Syrian household divisions of labor occurred at the intersection of inequalities in social policies, labor markets, and households. As a result of limited social assistance, the refugee families needed to earn an income within months of their arrival. The Syrian men entered the labor market, in keeping with a breadwinning expectation for their labor, but could only access menial jobs that limited their time and opportunity to learn English. Women, meanwhile, did not enter the labor market full-time and could attend English classes. By observing this divergence in men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs language learning, I theorize human capital as a gendered outcome of household divisions of labor. ¬© 2019 by The Author(s).

2-s2.0-68249140109	2009	Merrill-Palmer Quarterly	Gender similarities and differences in preadolescent peer groups: Group structure and ethnic diversity	The Social Cognitive Mapping procedure was used to identify peer social groups in 26 fifth-grade classrooms from six elementary schools in a northeastern urban school district. Four group structural features were examined: size, the number of subcliques, cohesion, and salience hierarchy. Ethnic diversity index was calculated for each group. An ethnically diverse sample of 318 fifth-grade students participated in the study, and 80 peer groups were included in the analyses. No gender difference was found in group size, cohesion, salience hierarchy, or ethnic diversity. Reliable gender differences were found in the number of subcliques within a group and in the individual child's involvement in any subclique, with higher levels for girls than for boys. However, the overall prevalence of subcliques was low. The findings highlighted strong similarities across the two genders and contradicted the predictions made by traditional sexualselection theory. Group features varied by status, indicating significant withingender variations. ¬© 2009 by Wayne State University Press.	Article	 United States
2-s2.0-84979031531	2016	Journal of Bisexuality	Ana√É¬Øs, Henry, and June: Reading Nonmonogamy in Literature	This article proposes a new reading methodology based on consensual nonmonogamous practices. Such a methodology, applied to texts whose characters engage in extramarital affairs, would shift the discussion from the axis of legitimacy/illegitimacy to an understanding of relationships based instead on mutual consent and sex positivity. Using Ana√É¬Øs Nin's famous Journals (and particularly Volume I [1931-1934] and Henry and June: The Unexpurgated Diary (1931-1932)of Ana√É¬Øs Nin) as paradigm, the author argues that the story of Henry and June is that of a coming of age of a polyamorous woman. This bold claim allows the author to compare this understanding of Nin with that of scholars and literary critics who read her affairs as illegitimate (notably critics who immediately responded to the scandalous revelations of her affairs with the publication of Henry and June in 1986). Reading Nin as a polyamorist rather than an adulteress transforms our understanding of her actions and even her persona as a writer. As an adulteress, she is a self-deceiving liar, a selfish, hypersexual woman who broke her husband's heart, and whose writing can hardly be trusted to reveal the truth. As a polyamorist, we can separate her relationships entirely from questions of truth and morality by recognizing that multiple romantic and/or sexual relationships with different partners can be perfectly healthy and have no bearing on a person's moral character or skills. My proposition for a reading methodology based in polyamory calls for a reconsideration of the literary tradition of the adultery novel, and particularly its intrinsic misogyny and sex negativity. More generally, this article also urges literary scholars to pay attention to the impact of mononormativity (or the set of discourses that posit monogamy as natural and uniquely desirable) into cultural products such as novels as well as literary metatexts. √Ç¬© 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Reflections on paradox performances in the recent reform processes in Germany [Familienpolitik ohne Gleichstellungspolitik? zu einigen Paradoxien aktueller familien-politischer Interventionen in Deutschland]	"This article analyses the lack of gender equality within the realm of family policies in Germany due to the conservativecorporate model of welfare-regime (Esping Andersen). Family policies in western Germany have promoted strong male breadwinner models which will become obsolete but [always] still persist. We argue that the recent turn in family policies which started at the beginning of this century can be seen as a late modernisation focussing on reforms which, connect family policies with employment policy, and gender equality with, the demands of employed parents. Two reforms, representative for this change are analysed in detail: the programme to significantly expand [of] publicly-provided childcare for young children (TAG) and the introduction of an earning-related parental benefit which strengthens the role of fathers as caregivers. Special attention is given to the expansion of family policies at the company level. Whether this ""economic turn"" is actually having an additional impact on gender equality is highly disputed in feminist studies. Family policies in conflict with gender equality?

These male plots are remarkably alike, and together, we argue, they indicate a rather progressive postfeminist model of gender. Beginning with alpha-male traits in common, from emotional inaccessibility to keen competitiveness, the stars of these stories follow similar bildungsroman plots. In this article, we chart the pattern of masculine development in three of these films‚ÄîCars, Toy Story, and The Incredibles‚Äînoting that Pixar consistently promotes a new model of masculinity. From the revelation of the alpha male's flaws, including acute loneliness and vulnerability, to figurative emasculation through even the slightest disempowerment, each character travels through a significant homosocial relationship and ultimately matures into an acceptance of his more traditionally ""feminine"" aspects. ¬© 2008 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

Framed within social support theory, the study used survey method with a sample of 98 teachers in Grades 6‚Äì12. The purpose was to examine the relation among GSAs, enumerated antibullying policies, and provision of LGBT-related training and teachers‚Äô knowledge and attitudes, as well as the frequency with which teachers engage in behaviors or activities to support LGBT youth. Results demonstrate that teachers reported a higher frequency of engaging in behaviors to support LGBT students when they worked in a school with an active GSA or enumerated antibullying policy and received training specifically related to LGBT youth. Across all teachers, ratings of the frequency of taking on supportive roles were significantly lower compared with their ratings of the importance of doing so. Despite acknowledging the need to support LGBT youth, teachers may not consistently intervene on behalf of LGBT students. Limitations as well as implications of these results for enhancing teacher training are discussed. ¬© 2016 Taylor & Francis.	Article	 United States

Participants completed a self-administered questionnaire and SG and BI women (n = 179) were matched to a sample of OG women (n = 179) based on age, income, geographical area, and children (having at least one 18-year-old or younger biological or adopted child at home). We assessed social milieu variables, risk factors for health disorders, mental health, and quality of mothers' relationship with children. The findings indicated a sexual orientation main effect: Mothers and non-mothers in the SG and BI group, as compared to their OG controls, were significantly less likely to live in a couple relationship, had significantly lower levels of social support, higher prevalence of early negative life events, substance abuse, suicide ideation, and higher levels of psychological distress. There were no Sexual Orientation X Parenthood status effects. The results further indicated that sexual orientation did not account for unique variance in women's psychological distress beyond that afforded by their social milieu, health risk factors, and parenthood status. No significant differences were found for the quality of mothers' relationship with children. SG-BI and OG mothers with low levels of social integration were significantly more likely to report problems with children than parents with high levels of social integration. We need to understand how marginal sexualities and their associated social stigma, as risk indicators for mothers, interact with other factors to impact family life, parenting skills, and children's adjustment. ¬© 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

A total of 375 non-athlete university students and 187 individual sport athletes, 18 years and older were included in the study. A significant main effect of symptoms on help-seeking intentions was observed among females and this was moderated by athlete status; female athletes with depression symptoms reported lower intentions than female non-athletes with depression symptoms. There was no main effect of symptoms among athletes, but a significant cross-over interaction effect of symptoms and gender on intentions was observed; non-symptomatic female athletes reported higher intentions than male athletes without symptoms, and female athletes with depression symptoms reported lower intentions than male athletes with depression symptoms. Results suggested that experiencing depression symptoms may decrease female athletes‚Äô intentions to seek help from psychologist. ¬© 2019 Human Kinetics, Inc.	Article	 Iceland

This research connected the constructs' relationships to the gender moderating effect in order to explain innovation orientation phenomenon and to confirm the Gender Constant Theory. The research employed the multiple group model comparison technique using AMOS. For female (n = 1.522), all seven path coefficients associated with the paths linking the four antecedents to innovation orientation and paths linking the three antecedents to entrepreneurial self-efficacy are significant. For male (n = 985), four path coefficients are significant: innovation motivation to entrepreneurial self-efficacy, entrepreneurial orientation to entrepreneurial self-efficacy, entrepreneurial orientation to innovation orientation and innovation motivation to innovation orientation. Male demonstrated a significantly stronger path coefficient from innovation motivation to entrepreneurial self-efficacy (Male: Œ≤ = 0.374, Female: Œ≤ = 0.175) whereas females demonstrated a significantly stronger path coefficient from creativity to entrepreneurial self-efficacy (Male: Œ≤ = 0.039, Female: Œ≤ = 0.297). Male structural model explained 65.0% variance. Female structural model explained 59.4% variance.

2-s2.0-27344445138	2005	Sexualities	Bisexual women, non-monogamy and differentialist anti-promiscuity discourses	Popular discourses on bisexuality assume a peculiar interrelation between bisexuality and non-monogamy. Drawing upon qualitative research in gay male and bisexual non-monogamies in the UK, this article explores bisexual women's accounts on the effects of promiscuity allegations on non-monogamous sexual and relationship practice. Due to the prominence of gender as a differentializing factor in the discourses on promiscuity, to be publicly known as bisexual and non-monogamous tends to have particularly stigmatizing effects on women. The issue is further complicated by the intersection of promiscuity discourses with discourses on race/ethnicity and class. The regimes of violence that go hand in hand with the stigmatization through promiscuity allegations police women's sexual behaviour making it more risky for women of certain positioning to come out or move and socialize in certain cultural contexts.

Learners' perceptions of Internet-based learning environments were explored and the role of gender was examined by using preferred and actual forms of a revised Constructivist Internet-based Learning Environment Survey (CILES). The students expressed a clear gap between ideal and reality, and they showed higher preferences for many features of constructivist Internet-based learning environments than for features they had actually learned in Demolab. The results further suggested that male users prefer to be involved in the process of discussion and to show critical judgments. In addition, male users indicated they enjoyed the process of negotiation and discussion with others and were able to engage in reflective thoughts while learning in Demolab. In light of these findings, male users seemed to demonstrate better adaptability to the constructivist Internet-based learning approach than female users did. Although this study indicated certain differences between males and females in their responses to Internet-based learning environments, they also shared numerous similarities. A well-established constructivist Internet-based learning environment may encourage more female learners to participate in the science community. ¬© 2008 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.	Article	 Taiwan

This article intends to carry out a theoretical survey on Gender Studies underlying their use in the audiovisual language. The specific subject of our survey is the TV series ¬´Top of the Lake¬ª (2013) signed, among others, by the New Zealand director Jane Campion. The series has turned out to be particularly interesting in terms of modification of the cultural and gender imaginary related to the woman and to the binomial male/female. The ¬´Top of the Lake¬ª TV series creates and offers the audience a sophisticated critique of the traditional visual codes normally associated to the gender, in order to hinder all passive identification processes to the characters represented on the screen. This case of study proves to be not only an interesting mix between authorship and mainstream language, but it‚Äôs also particularly appropriate for a gender analysis, as it shows the ability of audiovisual language to convey a problematic rep- resentation of prevailing social models. The work of Jane Campion, in harmony with the feminist theory, takes advantage of the television serial format in order to reflect, in a new revolutionary way, on the links between masculinity and femininity in the contemporary Western culture, showing how audiovisual representation can be a privileged dimension in the construction of meaning and collective consciousness. ¬© 2015, Edizioni Universitarie di Lettere Economia Diritto.

In this article, I explore this ambivalence by drawing on the experiences of migrant women, particularly mothers, focusing on the ways in which they negotiated their mobility with their partners. By analysing women's experiences of migration within a context of multi-sited and longitudinal, itinerant ethnography, I historicise their life accounts and place them within a broader framework of social and economic structural changes. On this basis I explore the concept of autonomy, particularly in relation to the exercise of women's agency within a context of market-oriented neoliberal reforms. I also question the potential of women's autonomy for gender equality and argue that there are at least two reasons for feminist scholars to continue being ambivalent towards autonomy. ¬© 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

2-s2.0-85024163527	2006	Journal of Global Ethics	Care, gender and global social justice: Rethinking ‚Äòethical globalization‚Äô	This article develops an approach to ethical globalization based on a feminist, political ethic of care; this is achieved, in part, through a comparison with, and critique of, Thomas Pogge‚Äôs World Poverty and Human Rights. In his book, Pogge makes the valid and important argument that the global economic order is currently organized such that developed countries have a huge advantage in terms of power and expertise, and that decisions are reached purely and exclusively through self-interest. Pogge uses an institutional rights framework to argue that direct responsibility for global poverty and inequality lies with the citizens of developed countries, since suffering and death are caused by global economic arrangements designed and imposed by our governments. While this argument is certainly compelling, I have argued that it tells us little about the actual effects of globalization on the real people of the South‚Äîincluding women, children and the elderly. As a result, it can offer little in the way of real alternatives or policy prescriptions. As a moral orientation, a care ethic relies on a relational moral ontology, and leads us to consider different values in terms of human flourishing. Moreover, it pushes us to consider the normative implications of aspects of the global political economy which are usually not ‚Äòseen‚Äô at all, including the global distribution of care work and the corresponding patterns of gender and racial inequality, the underprovision of care and resources for caring work in both the developed and developing world, and the ways in which unpaid or low-paid caring work helps to sustain a cycle of exploitation and inequality on a global scale. ¬© 2006 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

This tension can be observed in relation to the cultural activities of the island's young people, particularly the young men. The staging of bazar (neighbourhood fundraising parties), the making of ogoh-ogoh (giant papier-m√¢ch√© effigies to mark Nyepi, the Balinese New Year) and the competitive flying of oversize kites are-despite their sometimes contentious reception from older generations-popularly dubbed as 'traditional' expressions of Balinese youth culture. This recourse to tradition must be viewed in relation to two pervasive discourses: that of adat (customary law) and ajeg (a new protectionist ethos in the discourse on Balinese cultural identity). This paper argues that in contemporary urban Bali, male youth culture finds its most visible expressions in relation to the abiding standards of established public ritual and the equally abiding gender divisions that serve to guarantee the reproduction of 'traditional' social life. Rather than fighting aggressively against the grown-up norm, these expressions replicate the public culture of the adult world-while drawing on global and national youth styles-and strive towards the expression of a specifically 'Balinese' youth culture.

2-s2.0-14644420895	2005	Economic Development and Cultural Change	Public-private employment choice, wage differentials, and gender in Turkey	This study examines how individuals are selected into employment in public administration, SOEs, and covered private sectors and considers the wage determination in these sectors in Turkey. Individual-level data from the 1994 Household Expenditure Survey are used to assess the sectoral differentials for men and women separately. I distinguish among nonparticipation, public administration work, SOE work, covered private sector work, and other employment. Accordingly, a five-way multinomial logit model is estimated for sector selection. Mincerian sectoral wage equations are estimated taking sector selection into account. Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition of the wage differentials between sectors by gender and between men and women by sector are carried out. The central questions addressed are as follows: Do the relationships between wages and wage-determining factors differ by sector of work? Do public sector employees earn a premium? Are women discriminated against in the public sector? People commonly answer these queries negatively. The results for men indicate that when controlled for observed characteristics and sample selection, public administration wages are higher than private sector wages except at the university level where the wages are at par. The SOE wages are higher than private sector wages. The results are similar for women. Further, while there is parity in wages between sexes in public administration, there is a large gender gap in wages in the private sector in favor of men. Lower private returns to schooling are found in the noncompetitive public rather than in the competitive private sector. This article is organized as follows . A brief discussion of theoretical considerations appears in Section II. An overview of employment and wage-setting practices in public and private sectors in Turkey is provided in Section III. The conceptual framework and the empirical specification of the sectoral choice and wage equations are described in Section IV. Section V introduces the data used in this study. Estimation results are presented in Section VI. Section VII provides the policy implications of the results. Conclusions and suggestions for future research appear in Section VIII. ¬© 2005 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.	Article	 Turkey
2-s2.0-77953976353	2010	Journal of Research on Adolescence	Gender differences in depressive symptoms during adolescence: The contributions of weight-related concerns and behaviors	A theoretical model of gender differences in depressive symptoms during adolescence was evaluated using data from Waves I and II of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. The theoretical model under examination was primarily informed by the gender-additive model of gender differences in depressive symptoms during adolescence proposed by Stice and Bearman. In the model, it was posited that body mass index would be associated with perceiving oneself as overweight, which would then lead to a higher probability of dieting, which would be associated with greater depressive symptoms. Participants were 10,864 male and female adolescents. Gender did not moderate any of the model pathways, but mediation analysis indicated that gender differences in changes in depressive symptoms were mediated by perceived weight status and dieting. Findings suggest that one explanation for girls' higher depressive symptoms in adolescence relative to boys is girls' greater tendencies to perceive themselves as overweight and to diet. ¬© 2010, Copyright the Author(s).

2-s2.0-84919949523	2014	Gender Issues	Gender Embodiment as Gender-Enacted Body: A Review of Intimate Partner Violence and Gender Embodiment Perspectives	The author proposes the gender-enacted body as a better perspective of gender embodiment than the three current prevailing views: sex differences (the biomedical organism), socio-cultural imprint (the regulated body) and experienced gender (the lived body), which are not wrong, but misrepresentative of the active nature of gender embodiment. Gender embodiment is both an ongoing process of configuring subjectivity and the ensuing gendered agency. This implementation of the enacted body perspective is supported by two different arguments: first, a theoretical one to establish that the process of gender embodiment and the corporality that results from it are the settlement of human meaning and acting conditions; second, an empirical application of this perspective to resolve the shortcomings of current explanations of intimate partner violence in heterosexual couples by interpreting some well-known gender embodiment processes as enactment processes in which the body becomes an agent that generates practice. These gender-enacted bodies generate, in assemblage with the breakdown of the circuits of dependence within the couple, the agency of this kind of violence. ¬© 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

2-s2.0-22044446365	2005	Addictive Behaviors	Unaided smoking cessation and predictors of failure to quit in a community sample: Effects of gender	The majority of smokers who eventually quit do so without formal treatment, but few studies have examined a range of predictors of cessation among self-quitters and whether they differ depending on smokers' gender. The present study examined predictors of quitting in a community sample of 93 men and 117 women smokers attempting to quit on their own. Smokers were mailed a baseline questionnaire battery, and instructed to complete other measures the first and second day of their quit attempt. No gender difference in quit rates was observed, but predictors of smoking differed between men and women. Among men, alcohol use, caffeine consumption, and negative affect predicted smoking on quit day. Among women, nicotine dependence, age, ethnicity, weight control smoking, and not eating during urges predicted smoking on quit day. Social support seeking was negatively associated with smoking on the quit day among women, but the opposite relationship was obtained for men. Men's smoking 4 months later was predicted by baseline social pressures to quit and use of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). For women, weight control smoking and trait anxiety predicted smoking at the 4-month follow-up. ¬© 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	Article	 United States
2-s2.0-79959371131	2011	Sexualities	Forming sexualities as judicial virtues	This article explores the formation of sexuality in the institution of the judiciary. Its object of study is an archive made up of the texts of swearing in ceremonies of newly appointed judges of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, Australia. The texts, records of public events, demonstrate a remarkable consistency of general content and tone. They take the form of what might best be described as life writing (biography and autobiography). They have a strong hagiographic quality. Dedicated to writing the life of the newly appointed judge, they are a particular form of life writing devoted to the portrayal of state officials. As such they have a double function formulating and fashioning the subject not only as an exemplary individual life but also as a subject that embodies the virtues of the judicial institution. Each swearing-in document offers a textual portrait that makes and makes public the values and virtues of the institution of the judge. An important context for this study is an earlier empirical research project on sexual diversity in the judiciary. Key informants in that research advised me that sexuality was unlike the other strands of diversity. It was described as a personal and a private matter: strictly extra judicial. The primary objective of this essay is to explore how, if at all, sexuality is made in these public judicial ceremonies and texts, and more specifically, how the subject's sexuality is figured as an institutional ideal, as a judicial virtue. In undertaking this task the analysis will also examine some aspects of the role of gender in the formation of the judicial subject as a sexual subject. ¬© The Author(s) 2011.

These young people describe seeking support in San Francisco's well-known gay enclave, the Castro District, to form community and find safety from a homophobic and transphobic world. This study also explored difficulties these youth face as homeless LGBTQ young people of color navigating this neighborhood, which is widely considered a safe haven for LGBTQ people. In the Castro, they experienced invisibility, police and community harassment, sexual-ization, and commodification.

It argues that the rationale behind the ban is difficult to reconcile with legislation and practices beyond the merit of criminal justice. While an understanding of prostitution as ""men's violence against women"" may serve symbolic functions at central policy level, it can hardly guide local implementation without conflicting with core social policy principles. The article concludes that a there is a need to address the agency of people who sell sex, since denying or minimizing such agency may be counterproductive to the policy's own objectives. ¬© Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012."

We extended this work by demonstrating several forecasting errors regarding women's affective reactions to ambivalent sexism. In response to a survey about sexism against women, students at a university in the Central U.S. (N = 188) overestimated the negative impact of hostile sexism, and underestimated the negative impact of benevolent sexism, relative to women's reports of their actual experiences. Moreover, people mispredicted both the intensity of women's initial affective reactions to, and the duration of women's recovery following, ambivalent sexism. The data supported a model in which inaccurate estimates of initial intensity fully accounted for people's inaccurate estimates of recovery duration following ambivalent sexism. ¬© 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

It demonstrates that such nuances remain hidden in standard methods, such as surveys, generally used in the study of social capital. Furthermore, with a focus on the elderly migrants, the article illustrates that narratives have a particular affinity with migration, for like migrants they move across time and place.	Article	 K.
2-s2.0-84979971374	2017	Journal of GLBT Family Studies	Differences in Parental Monitoring Components and Their Associated Health Indicators Between Sexual-Minority and Heterosexual Girls	Our study sought to assess whether parental monitoring and their associations with health behaviors differed for heterosexual girls compared to sexual-minority girls (girls who identified as lesbian or bisexual, endorsed same-sex attraction, or had same-sex romantic or sexual partners). We analyzed three components of parental monitoring‚Äîadolescent disclosure, parental solicitation, and parental knowledge‚Äîbetween heterosexual and sexual-minority girls. We also tested if the associations between these three constructs and adolescent relationship abuse, suicidality, heavy drinking, binge drinking, anxiety symptoms, and depressive symptoms were different for heterosexual girls compared to sexual-minority girls. Sexual-minority girls were less likely to disclose accurately to their parents their location and activities and perceived their parents asked less and knew less about their location and activities than did heterosexual girls. Heterosexual girls who reported higher levels of adolescent disclosure were less likely than were sexual-minority girls to report suicidality and anxiety symptoms. Additionally, heterosexual girls who reported higher levels of parental knowledge were also less likely than were sexual-minority girls to report anxiety and depressive symptoms. These findings suggest that parental monitoring may not be as protective for sexual-minority girls as it is for heterosexual girls. ¬© 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.	Article	 United States
2-s2.0-85020401799	2017	Journal of Social and Personal Relationships	Adolescent romantic competence and parenting attitudes: Gender variations and correlates	The current study examined the distinctive gender-related expressions of adolescent romantic competence and patterns of maternal and paternal attitudes toward daughters‚Äô and sons‚Äô romantic involvements. Employing a qualitative approach, an in-depth interview assessing romantic competence was given to 69 Israeli adolescents (37 boys) ranging in age from 15 to 18 years, M = 16.74 (SD =.81). In addition, parents were interviewed regarding their attitudes toward their adolescents‚Äô romantic involvements. Findings indicated that girls exhibited greater romantic maturity and their accounts of romantic involvements were more coherent, compared to boys. Romantic agency did not differ across gender. Mothers and fathers reported similar levels of supportive attitude toward offspring‚Äôs romantic involvement. However, in depth reading of parents‚Äô motives suggested that fathers had a supportive attitude toward their sons‚Äô romantic and sexual experimentation, while mothers‚Äô supportive attitude was aimed at enhancing romantic intimacy in both genders. In addition, mothers were found to have a more protective attitude toward their daughters than toward their sons. Examining associations between parental attitudes and adolescent romantic competence showed that maternal, not paternal, supportive attitude was associated with greater romantic competence in both genders. In addition, maternal protective attitude was associated with girls‚Äô involvement in more stable relationships, while fathers‚Äô protective attitude was adversely associated with daughters‚Äô romantic agency. Findings suggest that the attitudes of both parents reflect, to some extent, the more traditional scripts of gender relationships. ¬© 2016, ¬© The Author(s) 2016.	Article	 Israel
2-s2.0-85028932388	2017	Studies in Gender and Sexuality	Beyond Sexuality, Beyond Perversion: The Annihilated Last Scream	Starting with an ancient, dark story from the Babylonian Talmud, the paper proposes that beyond severe sexual perversion lies‚Äîburied, silenced, annihilated‚Äîan infant‚Äôs last scream. This is explored in the theoretical-clinical psychoanalytic writing on the last scream, early breakdown, madness, and catastrophe and illustrated through a detailed account of an analysis with a severely fetishistic-masochistic patient. In this long and difficult analysis, the cessation of perverse practices led to an extreme collapse into breakdown, profound devastation, emptiness, psychic death, and suicidal despair. Working within this collapse in analysis enabled the deep reason for the patient‚Äôs breakdown in early life to unfold. And most important, it engendered the crucial possibility of reliving the patient‚Äôs unbearable breakdown, deadness, and last scream‚Äîthis time patient-with-analyst t(w)ogether‚Äîand experientially coming through it differently.

2-s2.0-84865093543	2012	Gender and Education	Approaching Southern theory: Explorations of gender in South African education	This article draws on the five other papers from South Africa in this issue of Gender and Education to consider how Southern theory has been developed and is developing in relation to gender and education in South Africa. We argue that Southern theory is not an on-the-shelf solution to global geopolitical inequalities but a work in process that is important both for the global South and to simultaneously dethrone and enrich Northern, mainstream theory. The article begins with a prologue explaining the origins and profile of the particular politics of knowledge production discussed in this issue. In the next section, we consider the notion of the 'global South' and trace the way in which knowledge itself is imprinted with the legacies of imperialism and colonialism, both in the North and in the South, with different agendas for theory arising from the historical positions of each. We then offer a very brief contextualisation of the issue in the specific context of South Africa, drawing on the articles to explore the particular nuances and issues raised by its particular historical and geopolitical location. In so doing, we point to some of the very difficult questions raised by the relationship between indigenous and modernist (Northern) knowledges. We move on to suggest some ways of thinking about intervening to challenge and potentially alleviate inequalities, showing that policy is not enough. In conclusion, we return to Southern theory, noting some of the limitations to which a journal like Gender and Education can contribute and the journey yet to travel while celebrating the fact and nature of this issue as a contribution to the development of Southern theory from and in South Africa. ¬© 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

Efforts to understand culturally appropriate and effective methods of HIV prevention services within the relatively understudied HBC are scarce (Phillips, Peterson, Binson, Hidalgo, & Magnus, 2011). This qualitative study, utilizing a diffusion of innovation theoretical framework, aimed to explore social norms regarding HIV and accessibility of HIV prevention services within the HBC. Thirty-seven participants (16 community leaders and 21 youths) engaged in focus group discussions. Participants discussed the perceptions of HIV and stigmatization within the HBC, general and HBC-specific risk factors for HIV transmission, as well as HIV prevention needs and strategies for culturally appropriate HIV interventions. Findings from this qualitative study highlight both the vulnerability of the HBC to HIV transmission and the corresponding support for HIV prevention interventions. ¬© 2015, Copyright ¬© Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Applied and general higher education gender stratification in Canada	In this chapter, we take up the distinction between applied and general fields of study in order to consider how patterns of gender stratification between them may differ. Purporting to offer industry- And firm-specific skills, applied fields of study are often differentiated from general education pathways that are offered within the university sector. However, as our research demonstrates, there is considerable interplay between these two forms of education when higher education engagement over the life course is examined. Using sequence and cluster analysis, we illustrate five ideal-typical higher education pathways in a sample of males and females over a 22-year period in the Canadian province of British Columbia. The gendered patterns of how individuals choose and move between general and applied fields of study offer a deeper account of stratification within general and applied skill acquisition and provide nuance concerning how vocational education can be conceptualised in relation to the actual higher education pathways students undertake. In Canada, where a high percentage of students gain university-level credentials, vertical and horizontal gender stratification within applied and general fields of study is distinctive and highlights system-specific engagement. ¬© 2015 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

We demonstrate that, besides commonly known factors such as the gender, animacy and morphology of the antecedent, the interface domain in which gender agreement takes place also seems to play a role in how accurately heritage speakers apply gender agreement. Pronominal reference, located at the external syntax-discourse interface, turns out to be more problematic than adjectival predication, which pertains to the internal morpho-syntax interface. Furthermore, we discuss the possibility that, besides the amount of input heritage speakers receive, the quality of this input may also play a role in their gender agreement accuracy, given that the heritage speakers' error pattern with respect to linguistic factors is very similar to that of first generation immigrants. ¬© Algemene Vereniging voor Taalwetenschap.

2-s2.0-85049299567	2018	Social Science Research	More religious, less dogmatic: Toward a general framework for gender differences in religion	Gender gaps in religiosity are among the most consistent findings in the social sciences. The literature, however, has typically under-emphasized gender theory, paid insufficient attention to variation across different contexts, and failed to consider styles of religious expression. This study draws on gender theory, brings religion and political attitudes research into dialogue, and explores potential gender differences in religious dogmatism (e.g., religious absolutism, exclusivity, and intolerance). Using U.S. data from the Baylor Religion Survey and cross-national data from the International Social Survey Programme, I demonstrate that women are generally more religious, but less dogmatic. As expected based on gender theory, however, the patterns I uncover are not universal and vary by societal context (i.e., Christian vs. non-Christian nations). I argue that religion appears to be a gendered sphere like any other in which we express our gendered selves, and that gender gaps in religion are the result not of essential differences, but of context-specific gender regimes, religion regimes, and the simultaneous ‚Äúdoing‚Äù of both gender and religion. ¬© 2018 Elsevier Inc.

This article explores collaborative governance from a gender perspective, specifically the perceptions of women in public‚Äìprivate‚Äìvoluntary sector partnerships. While previous research in this area has explored aspects of collaborative governance such as power, trust, accountability, decision-making, performance, exchange of information and participation, there is very little research on women within these networks.

We argue that women might expect to feel less good in contexts where unfavorable gender stereotypes are activated in their minds (e.g., by strong underrepresentation) and, consequently, are less likely to aspire to STEM careers. In two pilot studies (Ns = 28/61), we confirmed that undergraduate women expect more negative and less positive affect (i.e., generally (un)pleasant emotions) and a heightened sense of threat in a stereotype-activating, compared to a not stereotype-activating, test scenario. In Study 1 (N = 102), the scenario indirectly lowered college women‚Äôs STEM career aspiration (adjusted for preliminary domain identification) due to lower anticipated positive affect, but not to higher negative affect, in the stereotype-activating scenario. The scenario had no detrimental effect on college men‚Äôs anticipated affect or their career aspirations. In Study 2, 91 high school students reported anticipated affect and self-efficacy in different university majors and their intentions to choose the subject as a major. The more stereotypically male (in terms of gender distribution) the subject, the more negative and the less positive was young women‚Äôs, but not young men‚Äôs, anticipated affect. Only lower positive, but not higher negative, affect predicted low study intentions over and above self-efficacy. To increase women‚Äôs aspirations, their expected feelings in STEM deserve attention. One approach to foster positive affect might be to create less stereotypical STEM contexts. √Ø¬ø¬Ω 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.	Article	 Norway

Both local court cases concerning maintenance and policy debates at the national and imperial levels reveal the ways in which a breadwinner model of masculinity shaped maintenance policy and practice. Although the maintenance problem was framed differently by local welfare providers and imperial heads of state, concerns about welfare costs and human rights intersected in the figure of the irresponsible male citizen, who challenged the dominant model of British/imperial masculinity by refusing to maintain his wife. ¬© 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Interestingly, service background trainees scored comparatively higher on achievement, locus of control and self-esteem. Gender and background factors also interacted significantly in determining one's EAO. Copyright ¬© 2008 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.	Article	 India
2-s2.0-84899029963	2008	Advances in Accounting Education: Teaching and Curriculum Innovations	Revisiting hiring decisions by public accounting: The impact of educational path, age and gender	Changes in the public accounting labor market and accounting student demographics motivate updating our understanding of the student profile most attractive to CPA firm recruiters. In this exploratory study, public accounting assurance recruiters evaluated hypothetical job candidates with varying educational path, age and gender. We investigated whether accounting courses taken in a non-degree or post-baccalaureate certificate programs are valued differently than the same courses taken through a degree program. We also studied the effect of age and gender on recruiter decision-making. Our results indicate a recruiter preference for Master in Accounting and Management Information System degrees, and the post-baccalaureate certificate was not valued any differently from a bachelor's degree. Although gender appeared to have no effect on the recruiting decision, older students appeared to be assessed less favorably on some dimensions than their younger counterparts. These results are important to both accounting program administrators and students for the insights they provide into program design and counseling.Copyright ¬© 2008 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

2-s2.0-85050379545	2018	Group Processes and Intergroup Relations	‚ÄúWe for She‚Äù: Mobilising men and women to act in solidarity for gender equality	Gender (in)equality is typically studied as a women‚Äôs issue to be addressed via systemic measures (e.g., government policy). As such, research focusing on mobilising men (and women) towards achieving gender equality is rare. In contrast, this paper examines the mobilisation of both men and women towards gender equality as common cause. Experiment 1 shows that men‚Äôs collective action intentions increase after reading messages that position men as agents of change towards gender equality, compared to messages that frame this issue as stemming from inadequate government policy. Experiments 2 and 3 demonstrate that messages framing gender equality as an issue for both men and women increase men‚Äôs collective action intentions, compared to when gender inequality is framed as primarily concerning women. However, this effect emerges primarily under conditions where the source of message is male (Experiment 3). Practical and theoretical implications for mobilising political solidarity in gender equality contexts are discussed. ¬© The Author(s) 2018.	Article	 Australia
2-s2.0-58149267412	2008	Journal of Creative Behavior	Examining gender with general creativity and preferences for creative persons in college students within the sciences and the arts	The purpose of the research was to investigate gender similarities and differences in general creativity constructs with their preferences for creative persons. Data were collected from 247 participants (87 engineering, 24 psychology students with a psychology major, 51 psychology students with a major other than psychology, 30 English, and 55 music students) from a large Mideastern Big 10 university. All participants completed measures of general creativity (creative personality, creative temperament and cognitive risk tolerance) and a demographic questionnaire with the request to list 10 creative persons and their given field. Results indicated that males and females tended to have similar levels of general creativity, yet the most frequently listed creative eminent persons tended to be male. The most frequently listed creative person selections were in science and art, with the three most frequently selected eminent persons being in the science domains. The most frequent creative person selections, consistently selected by at least 10 participants, were Caucasian males.	Article	 OH 43210
2-s2.0-84898726288	2014	Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking	Does the mask govern the mind?: Effects of arbitrary gender representation on quantitative task performance in avatar-represented virtual groups	Virtual environments employing avatars for self-representation - including the opportunity to represent or misrepresent social categories - raise interesting and intriguing questions as to how one's avatar-based social category shapes social identity dynamics, particularly when stereotypes prevalent in the offline world apply to the social categories visually represented by avatars. The present experiment investigated how social category representation via avatars (i.e., graphical representations of people in computer-mediated environments) affects stereotype-relevant task performance. In particular, building on and extending the Proteus effect model, we explored whether and how stereotype lift (i.e., a performance boost caused by the awareness of a domain-specific negative stereotype associated with outgroup members) occurred in virtual group settings in which avatar-based gender representation was arbitrary. Female and male participants (N=120) were randomly assigned either a female avatar or a male avatar through a process masked as a random drawing. They were then placed in a numerical minority status with respect to virtual gender - as the only virtual female (male) in a computer-mediated triad with two opposite-gendered avatars - and performed a mental arithmetic task either competitively or cooperatively. The data revealed that participants who were arbitrarily represented by a male avatar and competed against two ostensible female avatars showed strongest performance compared to others on the arithmetic task. This pattern occurred regardless of participants' actual gender, pointing to a virtual stereotype lift effect. Additional mediation tests showed that task motivation partially mediated the effect. Theoretical and practical implications for social identity dynamics in avatar-based virtual environments are discussed. ¬© Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.	Article	 United States
2-s2.0-85040455542	2018	Human Relations	Coding military command as a promiscuous practice? Unsettling the gender binaries of leadership metaphors	Despite abundant scholarship addressed to gender equity in leadership, much leadership literature remains invested in gender binaries. Metaphors of leadership are especially dependent on gender oppositions, and this article treats the scholarly practice of coding leadership through gendered metaphor as a consequential practice of leadership unto itself. Drawing on queer theory, the article develops a mode of analysis, called ‚Äòpromiscuous coding‚Äô, conducive to disrupting the gender divisions that currently anchor most leadership metaphors. Promiscuous coding can assist leadership scholars by translating the vague promise of queering leadership into a tangible method distinguished by specific habits. The article formulates this analytical practice out of empirical provocations encountered by the authors: namely, a striking mismatch between their experiences in military fields and the dominant metaphor of leading as military command. Ultimately, the article seeks to move scholarly practices of leadership toward queer performativity, in the hopes of loosening other leadership practices from a binary grip and pointing toward new relational possibilities. ¬© 2017, ¬© The Author(s) 2017.

2-s2.0-70349465098	2009	Gender in Management	Patterns of online networking for women's career development	Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate how women working in science, engineering and technology use online networking, for career and professional development purposes. Design/methodology/approach: A combined qualitative and quantitative approach is taken, using interviews for the first phase of the research and online surveys for the second. The findings are discussed and presented with reference to theories on career development and in the context of recent work on women's networks and online social networking. Findings: The paper defines a typology of online networks and identifies the motives women have for engaging with the different types. The data imply that women are successfully using online networks to find support, advice and collaboration from women working in similar environments. However, the data only identify a few examples where the use of online networks has led to a specific new job opportunity. Research limitations/implications: The findings are limited by the samples used, as they were self-selected. In the first phase of the research, the sample was biased in favour of those using information and communication technologies. In the second phase, women using some form of online network were purposefully targeted in order to understand the motives and benefits associated with these activities. Originality/value: The paper provides new insights into how professional women are networking online. It extends recent work into women's networks and networking strategies and presents a timely exploration into how these are being affected by the growth of online social networking. ¬© Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

2-s2.0-33747649744	2006	Physiology and Behavior	Skipping breakfast: Gender effects on resting heart rate measures in preadolescents	The cardiovascular response in children to morning nutrition has received little attention, and associated gender-related effects are virtually uninvestigated. This study evaluated resting heart-rate (HR) and heart-rate variability (HRV) in preadolescents after overnight fasting and again after eating a standardized breakfast or continuing to fast. HR increased slightly after eating and decreased significantly with continued fasting. These effects were present for both sexes. Relative to children who ate, those who continued fasting showed increases in HRV-particularly for inter-beat-interval and low frequency component (LF: 0.04-0.15¬†Hz) measures. Analyses revealed significant increases across variability measures for fasting children, but a selective LF decrease in those who were fed-an effect most prominent in females. Otherwise, males and females showed similar treatment-related changes in HRV. While within-gender comparisons showed similar results for HR, i.e., faster HR in fed compared with fasting males and females, respectively, fasting females-but not males-showed significantly greater increases in variability relative to their fed counterparts. Together, these findings suggest that extended overnight fasting initiates an increase in parasympathetic activity that attenuates the expected increase in cardiovascular output following a mid-morning meal. Observed gender differences were related to greater parasympathetic activity in males and to the apparent emphasis on parasympathetic regulation of LF variability. The implications of these findings for health concerns, the nature of responses to physiological and cognitive stressors, and how such differences may influence performance variables-particularly early in development when cardiovascular responses to these stressors may be more sensitive to nutritional factors-are discussed. ¬© 2006 Elsevier Inc.

On the other hand, where bisexuality becomes ‚Äúactionable‚Äù in a workplace context (e.g., in its intersections with polyamory), it is insufficiently conformist or respectable for most employers to be able to account for and be inclusive of it in their institutional structures.

Methods: A brief health survey was administered by telephone to a probability sample of 11,529 residents of six southern states, over-sampling rural inhabitants. Results: Drinking patterns varied by gender, race, and rural residence in bivariate analysis. Gender effects were independent of rural residence, but race effects on abstinence and at-risk drinking were found only in urban residents and race differences in drinking quantity only in rural residents. Multivariate analysis, controlling for age and education, found gender and rural residence to be the strongest predictors, as well as being an African-American female. Conclusions: Female gender, African-American race, and rural residence appear protective for at-risk drinking but rural residence dominates racial differences. Copyright ¬© Informa Healthcare.

Recent recognition that schools can be violent places has tended to ignore the fact that many such acts originate in unequal and antagonistic gender relations, which are tolerated and 'normalised' by everyday school structures and processes. After examining some key concepts and definitions, we provide a brief overview of the scope and various manifestations of gender violence in schools, noting that most research to date has focused on girls as victims of gender violence within a heterosexual context and ignores other forms such as homophobic and girl-on-girl violence. We then move on to look at a few interventions designed to address gender violence in schools in the developing world and end by highlighting the need for more research and improved understanding of the problem and how it can be addressed.

In particular, I analyze two dominant, mutually constitutive sets of sexual scripts participants invoked in their bottom narratives: first, that bottoms are men who desire to produce pleasure for their partners; and second, that bottoms are men who desire to submit sexually to their partners. I argue that these scripted conceptions both give possibility to and constrain the ways in which participants interpret and experience their sexual practices and desires. I conclude by examining how these scripts operate as structurated social phenomena that shape the ways in which participants are able to navigate scenarios in which these scripts conflict directly with 'safer sex' scripts, potentially resulting in what I term 'pleasure/risk dilemmas'. ¬© The Author(s) 2011.

2-s2.0-84939429586	2015	Journal of Gay and Lesbian Social Services	A Be/Coming-Out Model: Assessing Factors of Resilience and Ambiguity	Sexual orientation, ‚Äúcoming out,‚Äù and the impacts of external stressors, resiliency, and losses remains an area not well understood. Being a sexual minority can result in ambiguous losses that potentially complicate established or formative resilience. These types of losses are largely overlooked and little research exists on how these loss(es) impact lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) populations (Boss, 2006). This article presents a ‚ÄúBe/Coming-Out‚Äù model to better assess and understand three interactive life dimensions: self-perceptions, social relationships, and society structures. The model depicts the ongoing and multilayered interactions, highlighting areas of resiliency and ambiguity, including potential risk factors and barriers to formation of resiliency behaviors. Discussion focuses on be/coming out as a lifelong process and applying the model as a tool in assessing individuals and couples levels of resiliency, as well as potential ambiguous losses related to sexual minority identity. ¬© 2015, Copyright ¬© Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

2-s2.0-85042925173	2018	Gender, Place and Culture	‚ÄòThe Tent‚Äôs Big Enough for Everyone‚Äô: online slash fiction as a site for activism and change	This article draws on a piece of wide-scale mixed-methods research (n¬†=¬†429) that examines how women who write and read male/male erotica feel their involvement with the genre has affected their views on gender and sexuality and their political engagement with gay rights issues. Previous work has looked at how online slashfic communities might provide a safe space for exploring gender performance and sexuality, while other researchers have observed a tension between those who identify as queer themselves and those who only ‚Äòplay at queerness‚Äô exclusively within the online environment. However, much of this work has examined the theoretical positioning of such forums as transgressive and/or political. Far fewer pieces have attempted to engage with the women who frequent such sites to ask them about whether their involvement in these online spaces has affected their attitudes and behaviours. This study looks not only at the ways in which online m/m fandoms can act as a safe space for women to explore their sexualities and gender identities, but whether and how these insights connect to women‚Äôs real-world lives. Data presented here shows a strong consensus among participants that involvement with explicit slash communities has had a positive effect on their lives, as well as contributing to beneficial changes in their knowledge, attitudes, and practices with regards to LGBTQ+ issues. Overall, slash is seen as a medium which can create better allies, encourage cross-identification, and bring about positive personal changes. To this extent, I argue that explicit online slash sites can act as heterotopias. ¬© 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.	Article	 United Kingdom

Women by and large staff these occupations which are also called 'relationship work'. In this article we compare the feminine ideal (often implicitly derived from a maternal ideal) with the ideal held by female relation workers. We suggest that taken for granted ideals of perfectionism in mothering are carried into relation work by the female relation workers themselves and the society at large. As a consequence, female relationship workers have a constrained portrait of themselves, leaving little opportunity and permission to explore the difficult emotional and situational complexities that they experience in their professional practice. Psychoanalytic and feminist perspectives allow challenging of these constraining implicit ideals. We argue the need for an expanded ideal that allows for negative feelings, creativity and uncertainty in professional relationships. ¬© 2010 GAPS.	Article	 Canada

The focus of the study is public relations practitioners operating in seven consultancies across the UK, in Manchester, London, Yorkshire and Cheshire. Using qualitative methodologies including in-depth interviews and network mapping, the study reveals practitioners' network size and variety of contacts, and their role in client acquisition and retention. In particular, the study suggests that position and gender are two key influences on practitioners' personal networks. The study appears to identify that managers may have the smallest networks compared to their colleagues and especially lack weak tie contacts in the form of friends, and that female practitioners may have larger and more varied personal contact networks than men. The study thus offers an insight into personal network membership for public relations practitioners, hitherto unexplored, plus a deeper understanding of interactional dimensions of social networks and the gendered nature of networking in the UK public relations sector. ¬© 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Using critical textual analysis, this study examined how media took a horror-themed meme from the underbelly of the Internet and curated a moral panic, once the meme was thrust into the international limelight. Because memes are a particular intersection of images and technology, media made sense of this meme-inspired attack in three ways: (1) through an idolatrous tone that played on long-standing Western anxieties over images; (2) by hyper-sensationalizing women‚Äôs so-called frivolous uses of technology; and (3) by removing blame from the assailants and, in turn, finding the Internet and the Slender Man meme guilty in the court of public opinion. Through this tripartite rhetoric, this study suggests that when media set out to curate a moral panic surrounding images and technology, together, the discourse that emerges is one that feminizes the Internet, turning it into technology-as-mother and image-as-child. This study also suggests this is the case because when women receive macro-level structure equality, micro-level inequities and attempts of control against them increase. Digital and image rhetoric are not exceptions. ¬© 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.	Article	 United States

Four years prior, against the backdrop of a violent rape in the nation‚Äôs capital of Delhi, prominent feminists and activists took to the streets as part of mass public protests calling for legal protections for women in India. The response to the New Year‚Äôs Eve allegations, however, differed in two ways. The first was the conspicuous role social media played for the first time in the feminist movement in India. The second was the leadership provided by young feminists in the country. A coalition of various feminist organisations and individuals banded together to form a collective under the hashtag #IWillGoOut. This article discusses feminist activism over a period of two weeks at the start of 2017, when the #IWillGoOut collective rapidly mobilised widespread public support calling for the safety of women and minorities in public spaces in India. The campaign organised and led marches and events in over 30 towns and cities of India with no formal fundraising effort. I draw on my personal experience of organising the campaign to share insights into its success in transforming online support to offline action using social media. This experience provides a useful example that can be used in other social justice movements in the Indian subcontinent. ¬© 2018, ¬© 2018 Oxfam GB.	Article	 India

Middle-Class Women and Gender Inequality in Ho Chi Minh City	Despite considerable material and social gains, urban middle-class women in turn of the 21st century Vietnam continued to face gender inequality. Although the nature of gender inequality had certainly changed in the preceding approximately two decades, it nonetheless continued to impact these women's lives, showing little or no sign of abating. Investigating these developments for more than a decade, the research upon which this article is based provides ethnographic evidence of the persistence of gender inequality, documenting the disproportionate share of work or burden with which middle-class women were shouldered. This burden came in three basic arenas: work outside the home, work inside the home, and sociocultural or symbolic work. Combined, these three pillars of inequality demonstrate that gender norms and expectations in Vietnam, while certainly not static, are best understood as a refashioned version of the longstanding imbalance between men and women in a society wherein healthy gender relations have remained at least partly illusive. ¬© 2015 American Anthropological Association.

A gender comparison among Asian-Americans nationwide	Objectives: We examined whether similarities and differences exist in the association between perceived discrimination and poor mental and physical health among Asian-American adult women and men. We also tested whether Asian-American women would have a lower perceived discrimination threshold for developing negative health outcomes than Asian-American men. Methods: Data were derived from the National Latino and Asian-American Study (2002-2003). A nationally representative sample of Asian-American adults (1,075 women and 972 men) was examined. Results: There were more gender similarities than differences in the strong association between discrimination and health. More prominent gender differences were found for the specific level of discrimination and its potential health effects. Specifically, for both Asian women and men, a high level of perceived discrimination showed stronger associations with mental health than with physical health outcomes. And yet, compared with men, the threshold of discrimination was lower for women in affecting mental and physical health status. Conclusion: The findings underscore that a high level of discrimination was associated with negative mental and physical health outcomes for both women and men. However, women had more negative mental and physical health outcomes when exposed to a lower threshold of discrimination than men. These findings suggest that failing to examine women and men separately in discrimination research may no longer be appropriate among the Asian-American population. Future research should focus attention on the biological, social, and political mechanisms that mitigate the adverse health effects of discrimination in order to develop a more comprehensive approach to eliminate disparities in health. ¬© 2010 Jacobs Institute of Women's Health.

2-s2.0-85012077962	2017	Studies in Social Justice	The ordinary and extraordinary: Producing migrant inclusion and exclusion in US sanctuary movements	"This article analyzes the Sanctuary Movement for Central Americans and the New Sanctuary Movement, two United States faith-based social movements, to think through the ways in which these pro-immigrant efforts paradoxically render migrants figuratively mute and often excluded from conceptualizations of the nation and its inhabitants even as they advocate for legal inclusion. We examine this tension of inclusion and exclusion through the frequent representation of migrants' histories and Christianity as extraordinary in the Sanctuary Movement for Central Americans, and migrants' lives as ordinary in the New Sanctuary Movement. We identify two key processes by which this framing of migrants as extraordinary or ordinary limits the enactment of full social, political, and economic inclusion: (a) public support is principally granted to certain stories, religions, identities, and experiences; and (b) migrants are consistently positioned, and often celebrated, by sanctuary activists as ""others."" The discourses of migrants as extraordinary or ordinary effectively generate broad involvement of faith communities in sanctuary work. Yet, as we argue, this framing comes with the cost of limiting activist support only to particular groups of migrants, flattening the performances of migrant identities, and positioning migrants as perpetually exterior to the US.

2-s2.0-77952631308	2008	Journal of International Women's Studies	The role of gender, self-efficacy, age and extroversion on smoking behaviour among Ambrose Alli University Students, Ekpoma, Nigeria	This study examined the role of gender, self-efficacy, age and extroversion on smoking behavior among Ambrose Alli University Students. Two hundred and fifty (250) undergraduates participated in the study (males 160 and females 90). Questionnaire was used in collecting data that were analyzed in this study. The questionnaire consisted of 4 sections: the demographic variables, extroversion scale, self-efficacy scale and attitude toward smoking scale. Two out of the four hypotheses tested were supported. Results of the independent t-test indicated that there was a significant difference in the onset of smoking between females and males (t = 2.354, df = 248, P = <.05). Result also showed that self-efficacy was significant when considering attitudes toward smoking behavior (t = 3.256, df = 248, P = <.05). However, age and extroversion was not found to be significant while considering smoking initiation and cessation. Based on the findings of this study it was recommended that the smokers' self-efficacy and gender must be taken seriously while considering smoking cessation. It also has implication for counseling.

2-s2.0-84946174925	2015	Research in the Sociology of Work	Intersectional differences in segmented assimilation: Skill and gender in the context of reception	Purpose - Segmented assimilation theory predicts that contemporary non-white groups follow three patterns of assimilation: mainstream, downward, or delayed. Yet, the homogenous treatment and primacy of ethnicity resigns all group members to a similar fate. Whereas few studies of ethnic incorporation consider both the classed and gendered nature of the labor market, this study investigates the extent to which intersectional group differences within the highly stratified American economy shape segmented assimilation trajectories. Methodology/approach - This study introduces an intersectional approach to segmented assimilation theory. Using the 2000 census, this study examines how within group differences in skill and gender condition the hourly earnings, joblessness and self-employment participation outcomes of five ethnic minority groups from the first to the second generation, compared against US-born, non-Hispanic whites.Findings - Findings generally support the mainstream assimilation hypothesis for all groups; a downward assimilation trajectory among Chinese men only; and a delayed assimilation trajectory for low-skilled Filipinas and high-skilled Cuban men and women. This study reveals that intra-group differences in skill and gender shape divergent segmented assimilation trajectories among members of the same ethnic group. Originality/value - This study challenges the emphasis on and primacy of ethnicity in predicting segmented assimilation in favor of an intersectional approach that considers how multiple, interdependent, and intersecting dimensions of identity and not only ethnicity shape the process of economic incorporation among ethnic groups. ¬© 2015 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

2-s2.0-84859810359	2012	Gender, Work and Organization	'It's People's Whole Lives': Gender, Class and the Emotion Work of User Involvement in Mental Health Services	The concept of emotion work has been widely applied to the study of service work. Yet its use in understanding the social dynamics of user involvement in public services remains under explored. Drawing on a study of user involvement in mental health service development, I show its utility for understanding this social and political realm. The article discusses findings from a critical discursive and contextual emotional labour perspective, taking into account organizational and institutional factors as well as social structural dimensions of gender and social class. It shows how discourses on emotion, constructed through articulation of personal experiences of service usage both reflected and constructed the ideological and structural positionings of women service users, while emotional discourse - displays of anger in user involvement forums - worked to constitute traditionally male and ideologically masculine elements of the field, as well as the working-class identities of some participants. These forms of emotion work, and the ways in which they elicited further emotion management from service users and workers alike, are located in relation to the rules of engagement of user involvement and the bureaucratic institutional forms within which this took place. The article concludes that the emotion work of user involvement ultimately helped to reproduce the dominant institutional and social order, including its gender and class dimensions. Implications for policies and practices of user involvement in mental health services are provided. ¬© 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.	Article	 United Kingdom

Utilizing a sample of 789 California mothers followed for 10 years after admission to women-only (WO) or mixed-gender (MG) drug treatment, we examine the relationship between WO treatment and outcomes and whether it is mediated by post-treatment exposures to criminal justice and health services systems. At follow-up, 48% of mothers had a successful outcome (i.e., no use of illicit drugs, not involved with the criminal justice system, alive). Controlling for patient characteristics, WO (vs. MG) treatment increased the odds of successful outcome by 44%. In the structural equation model WO treatment was associated with fewer post-treatment arrests, which was associated with better outcomes. Women-only substance abuse treatment has long-term benefits for drug-dependent mothers, a relationship that may be partially explained by post-treatment exposure to the criminal justice system. Findings underscore additional leverage points for relapse prevention and recovery-supportive efforts for drug-dependent mothers. ¬© 2013.	Article	 United States

Although not an official diagnosis in the current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, premenstrual dysphoric disorder has received increasing attention in the clinical literature, and considerable debate exists regarding the validity of this proposed condition. This study examined the prevalence of premenstrual dysphoric disorder in a sample of women and men and assessed the construct validity of the disorder. Twenty percent of women met the criteria for provisional diagnosis of premenstrual dysphoric disorder using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual criteria. In addition, 4% of men met these criteria when given sex-neutral assessment forms. Self-reported psychological distress and impaired interpersonal functioning did not predict women's likelihood of meeting the criteria for premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Results cast doubt on the sex-specificity of the diagnostic criteria of premenstrual dysphoric disorder and the construct validity of the disorder. Limitations of this study are discussed.

2-s2.0-84856280285	2012	Management Science	Gender, competition, and managerial decisions	The purpose of this study is to investigate the use of competitive compensation between a manager and a worker in the laboratory. To this end, we impose a simple agency relationship between two groups of subjects termed managers and workers. The manager chooses a compensation scheme for the worker from either a piece rate or a tournament payment scheme and is paid based on the workers performance in the task. The results indicate that when given information about worker ability, male managers choose the tournament significantly less often for a female worker. On the other hand, when no information about worker ability is given to the manager, there is no difference in compensation choice for the worker, although male and female managers differ significantly in their own preferences for compensation scheme. We conjecture that these results are tied to the fact that there is a measurable stereotype that females are worse at the task relative to males, although further research is needed in this regard. ¬© 2012 INFORMS.

2-s2.0-80051843960	2011	Culture, Health and Sexuality	Gender scripts and unwanted pregnancy among urban Kenyan women	Women's lived experiences and lay accounts of unwanted pregnancy remain poorly interrogated. We investigated portrayals of unwanted pregnancy using narrative data gathered from 80 women in Nairobi, Kenya. Unwanted pregnancy had a diversity of significance for the women. Pregnancies were not simply unwanted because they occurred when women became pregnant without wanting to. Rather, pregnancies were considered unwanted largely because they had occurred in contexts that did not reinforce socially-sanctioned notions of motherhood and 'proper' procreation and/or revealed women's use of their sexuality in ways deemed culturally-inappropriate. Kenyan women's invocation of femininity scripts to explain unwanted pregnancy; the centrality of gender in everyday life in contemporary Kenya; women's and girls' poor access to effective family planning services; growing female poverty; and Kenya's restrictive abortion policy imply that unwanted pregnancy and its consequences will persist in the country. Addressing unwanted pregnancy and its consequences requires making accessible quality contraceptive and abortion services as well as sexuality information. It also calls for providers who understand the socio-cultural norms that circumscribe fertility and reproductive behaviours. ¬© 2011 Taylor & Francis.	Article	 South Africa

A glimpse into the lives and minds of female yo-yo dieters - The curtain has lifted in U.K.?	Yo-yo dieting is a common phenomenon yet little interdisciplinary research has been carried out on dieting, food and nutrition in the social context. This study investigated the effects of yo-yo dieting on social and psychological well-being using qualitative methods. Data were collected by conducting semi-structured interviews with women who yo-yo diet. A total of 9 participants, 20-51 years old, were recruited by purposive and snowball sampling techniques from the University of Roehampton, London, U.K., where the first author was a student at the time of the study. Thematic analysis derived four major themes: the physical and/or mental impact of yo-yo dieting, the similarity of reported symptoms with those associated with eating disorders, familial and sociocultural pressure for initiating diets and the struggle for control and/or identity. Furthermore, there appears to be a link between yo-yo dieting and interviewees' references to depressive mood episodes. The implications of these findings for the risks of developing eating disorders are discussed. ¬© 2013 Journal of International Women's Studies.	Article	 United Kingdom
2-s2.0-85011035336	2016	Electronic Journal of Research in Educational Psychology	Immigration and gender as differentiating elements in the motivation and strategies of Spanish secondary students	Introduction. The debate over the education of immigrant pupils relative to native Spanish students is currently a hot topic, but very little research has been undertaken in this area in Spain. The objective of this study was to detect certain possible differences in motivation and strategies between immigrant and Spanish pupils, and also between boys and girls. Method. A sample of 436 secondary school pupils was used. The Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ) was used as a basis, but was adapted in the shape of the elimination of the goal sub-scales (intrinsic and extrinsic), which were replaced by the Goal Orientation Scale of Skaalvik. Various Student's t-tests were carried out to determine whether or not there were statistically significant differences between the independent samples studied, concretely in respect of nationality of origin and of gender. In interpreting results, account was also taken of the effect of the size of sample. Moreover, MANOVA analyses were also used to check whether there were any interactions between the nationality of origin and gender in respect of the variables studied. Results. In general, it was noteworthy that the main differences found were linked to the gender of pupils, much more than their nationality of origin. Hence, statistically significant differences were found in a total of twelve variables by gender and only three by nationality. Moreover, differences encountered lay mostly in the area of learning strategies rather than in academic motivation and self-motivation. Discussion and conclusion. As a general conclusion for this study, it may be emphasized that the main differences recorded were in respect of gender, much more than with regard to the nationality of origin. More specific studies would be desirable so as to develop further this line of investigation, which is novel in a Spanish context. ¬© Education & Psychology I+D+i and Ilustre Colegio Oficial de la Psicolog√≠a de Andaluc√≠a Oriental (Spain).

2-s2.0-84859116157	2011	Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies	Whiteness and Diasporic Irishness: Nation, Gender and Class	Whiteness is often detached from the notion of diaspora in the recent flurry of interest in the phenomenon, yet it is a key feature of some of the largest and oldest displacements. This paper explores the specific contexts of white racial belonging and status over two centuries in two main destinations of the Irish diaspora, the USA and Britain. Its major contribution is a tracing of the untold story of 'How the Irish became white in Britain' to parallel and contrast with the much more fully developed narrative in the USA. It argues that, contrary to popular belief, the racialisation of the Irish in England did not fade away at the end of the nineteenth century but became transmuted in new forms which have continued to place the 'white' Irish outside the boundaries of the English nation. These have been strangely ignored by social scientists, who conflate Irishness and working-class identities in England without acknowledging the distinctive contribution of Irish backgrounds to constructions of class difference. Gender locates Irish women and men differently in relation to these class positions, for example allowing mothers to be blamed for the perpetuation of the underclass. Class and gender are also largely unrecognised dimensions of Irish ethnicity in the USA, where the presence of 'poor white' neighbourhoods continues to challenge the iconic story of Irish upward mobility. Irishness thus remains central to the construction of mainstream 'white' identities in both the USA and Britain into the twenty-first century. ¬© 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

First, the authors examined differences between White heterosexual (n = 97) and sexual minority (e.g., gay, bisexual, and queer; n = 83) men on various racial attitudes and empathy. Second, they examined whether highlighting oppressed identity status with an experimental prime could influence racial empathy. Third, the authors investigated whether sexual orientation disclosure and experiences with heterosexist discrimination among sexual minority men were associated with racial attitudes directly and indirectly through racial empathy. Key findings included: (a) sexual minority participants demonstrated more positive racial attitudes and empathy than heterosexual men; (b) there was no effect of prime on racial empathy; and (c) sexual orientation disclosure and experiences with heterosexism were associated significantly with positive racial attitudes indirectly through racial empathy.

As part of the development of an HIV prevention intervention for men, key informant interviews and focus group discussions were conducted. Several themes regarding the construction of gender were identified. First, participants reported that traditional gender relations of male dominance and female subservience were still in evidence, along with traditional gender roles that mandated a division of labour between the household and paid workforce. Second, participants reported a shift in gender roles and relations in the direction of increased power for women. Last, hostile resistance to changes in gender power relations was evident in the discussions. Redefining masculinity and femininity and shifting gender relations in the direction of 'power with' instead of 'power over' is perhaps a necessary prelude to lasting social change and curbing the HIV epidemic in South Africa. ¬© 2008 SAGE.

Through semiotic analysis of certain sections of the magazines, I point out the underlying normative and ideological assumptions in order to show how these magazine representations position women; and how semiotics wield power in marginalizing the role of women in society. The restrictive nature of discourses on femininities is highlighted through an analysis of discursive linguistic and semiotic techniques and devices. I argue that the role of semiotics is central in shaping and reinforcing such asymmetrical, gendered and sexist social patterns and practices and that these images (can) have repercussions with regard to women's sexuality(ies) and their social roles and identities. ¬© 2009 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.

Drawing on constructionist perspectives of gender and sexuality, as well as qualitative data from interviews with parents of transgender and gender-nonconforming children, this article examines parents‚Äô contrasts between ‚Äújust gay‚Äù and ‚Äútruly trans‚Äù assessments of childhood gender nonconformity. Through these distinctions, parents reiterate that gender and sexuality are separate spheres of identity and experience, echoing mainstream LGBT rights discourses. However, throughout their narratives, ‚Äúgay‚Äù kinds of gender nonconformity were occasionally re-considered as ‚Äútrans‚Äù kinds of gender nonconformity after all, such that these otherwise distinct realms of experience intermittently overlapped and switched along an imagined ‚Äúspectrum‚Äù of LGBTQ possibilities. In the absence of any firm ‚Äúbiological‚Äù markers or predictors for such distinctions, I argue that parents‚Äô intellectual, conceptual, and discursive labor in these ways proves a key social process through which (trans)gendered self-conceptions are given increasing intelligibility, and opportunity, in the 21st century, for their children and for others. ¬© 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

2-s2.0-85021097224	2017	Mental Lexicon	The influence of grammatical gender and suffix transparency in processing Italian written nouns	In some languages the grammatical gender of nouns can be probabilistically detected using formal cues; for instance, in Italian, the majority of feminine nouns end in '-a'(e.g., casa, 'home') and the majority of masculine nouns end in '-o' (e.g., albero, 'tree'). It has been hypothesized that the match/mismatch between the formal information of the suffix and the abstract grammatical information on gender affects lexical processing of nouns. An alternative account is that a default option available for gender poses constraints to mechanisms of lexical access for words exhibiting gender markers in the surface form. In the present study, nouns with highly predictive gender suffix (regular), nouns whose gender cannot be recovered from surface form (opaque) and nouns with misleading gender suffix (irregular) were compared in two reading aloud and two lexical decision experiments. Results confirmed that regular nouns are processed better than irregular nouns. No difference was detected between masculine and feminine opaque nouns. The results allow the conclusion that a formal gender feature (the gender orthographic regularity) is more likely to affect lexical processing of bare nouns than the activation of a gender default option.

Rather than building on the rights-based development and best practices of the 1990s, they ignore the critical roles of political capacity and participation that the past forty years and feminist analysis of development achievements and failures have taught us are essential to taking on gender and economic inequality. Certain trends in foreign aid accountability share this silence on the importance of political capacity. In contrast, the rights-based approach to gender equality and development (RBA) is a political approach to development. We reconcile the need for aid accountability with the need for a focus on politics by outlining key political processes of the rights-based approach. The RBA is a way of doing development that is attentive to process and power. We can use the RBA not just as a guide for how to do development, but also as a way to think about processes as outcome measures. The processes that the RBA requires are processes that build capacity for marginalized women and people. ¬© 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.	Article	 United States

Contrary to popular perceptions, this research finds no evidence to suggest that participating in digital gaming can have a negative effect on levels of sports participation. Moreover, the paper argues that, for some, digital gaming may increase their interest and knowledge of sport, and can prove for many a popular source of conversation that can cross-cut and inform conversations on sport.

2-s2.0-78049499713	2010	Citizenship Studies	Gender, family law and citizenship in Syria	This paper explores the impact of family law on the structuring of gendered citizenship in Syria where the state's family law accords male and female citizens different legal status, thus ordering the distribution of basic rights and duties along gendered lines. Partial centralization and fragmented secularization of judicial authority relates to the accommodation of religious groups, a policy which was continued after the establishment of territorial states in the 1920s. Family law maintained its religious tenets and was included as part of the state's jurisdiction. The impact of family law on citizenship is exacerbated in that membership in religious groups is mandated and monitored by the state. Citizenship is thus mediated through a citizen's membership in a religious group where the religiously based family law applies as state law. Seen in theoretical terms, family law plays a crucial role in structuring gendered citizenship in ways that limit the legal authority of female citizens as full members of the polity. Two questions are addressed: First, how and why does family law premise gendered citizenship in Syria? Second, what characterizes the debates regarding changes within family law that surfaced after 2003 following the political regime's liberalization efforts? ¬© 2010 Taylor & Francis.	Article	 Norway

Based on the results, we suggest that self-objectification brings about contingent self-esteem. This mental state can explain changes in self-esteem in turn. We propose that contingent self-esteem can play an essential role in the context of objectification theory. ¬© 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.	Article	 Iran
2-s2.0-84981489554	2017	Feminist Media Studies	Cyborg witches: class composition and social reproduction in the GynePunk collective	This paper takes Haraway‚Äôs techno-scientific concept of the cyborg as the basis for understanding a feminist theory of class that is rooted in socially reproductive labour. Arguing that the Operaismo notion of class composition ignored reproductive labour as either a technical or political component of proletarian composition, this article claims that social reproduction in fact provides the foundation for both. Through the notion of the cyborg, this article situates class as a human and machinic con, which is at once conquered by capital‚Äôs technological methods of accumulation but also finds its modes of resistance within these same convergences. Using the GynePunk collective‚Äôs DIY reproductive health technologies as an example of class composition through cyborgic social reproduction, this article aims to develop a techno-feminist concept of class suitable to the prevailing technological conditions of our time. ¬© 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

2-s2.0-84970021092	2017	Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy	The Role of Gender as a Moderator of the Alliance-Outcome Link in Acute Inpatient Treatment of Severely Disturbed Youth	Research is needed to further examine the role of treatment alliance or engagement among child and adolescent patients in inpatient psychiatric settings. In this study, 72 newly admitted patients on an inpatient adolescent psychiatric unit completed measures of symptom severity and treatment alliance. Female patients showed greater symptom severity at both admission and discharge. Residualized gain score analysis showed that male gender predicted greater symptom reduction. Treatment alliance also predicted greater symptom reduction, but only among women. These results suggest that alliance or engagement with acute inpatient psychiatric services may play a more important role among women than men in predicting symptomatic change in severely disturbed adolescents.

2-s2.0-84942986880	2015	Gender and Education	‚ÄòGood girls‚Äô: emphasised femininity as cloning culture in academia	Gender inequality in academia might be understood as an effect of the belief of a contradiction between woman and science, which make it difficult for women to appropriate the right to author and authorise acts of knowing and thinking in science. In relation to this concern, the aim of this article is to explore how a group of successful women researchers do science and uphold their position as researchers. It is based on evidence from participant observation and qualitative interviews. Theoretical understandings of femininity and cloning culture are used to analyse how the women united as a group that displays a subordinate, heterosexual femininity. Their strategies might be understood as a form of cultural cloning. By expressing a collective emphasised femininity grounded in white, heterosexual, middle-class norms, the women experienced a sameness that rendered them strong as a group and well adapted in academia. ¬© 2015 Taylor & Francis.

2-s2.0-84856460900	2011	International Journal of Consumer Studies	Materialism, fashion consumers and gender: A cross-cultural study	The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships among materialism, gender and fashion consumer groups from two countries - one representative of an individualistic culture (US) and one representative of a collectivistic culture (Korea). Participants were 397 students from a university in Korea (n=221) and a university in the US (n=176) who completed the questionnaire. The materialism construct showed adequate reliability for participants in both cultures. Fashion change agents scored higher on materialism (centrality and success) than fashion followers. Females scored higher on materialism than males which seemed to be based on higher scores on the centrality subscale. Participants from the US and Korea differed on all three subscales of materialism with US participants scoring higher on centrality but lower on success and happiness than Korean participants. The findings of this study provide valuable implications for fashion marketers and retailers in Korea and US. The findings are limited to Korean and US consumers and cannot be generalized to other cultures. This paper fills a gap in the literature by comparing materialistic values between genders and fashion consumer groups in an individualistic culture (US) and a collectivistic culture (Korea). ¬© 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

2-s2.0-33947182860	2007	Criminology	The context of marriage and crime: Gender, the propensity to marry, and offending in early adulthood	Marriage is central to theoretical debates over stability and change in criminal offending over the life course. Yet, unlike other social ties such as employment, marriage is distinct in that it cannot be randomly assigned in survey research to more definitively assess causal effects of marriage on offending. As a result, key questions remain as to whether different individual propensities toward marriage shape its salience as a deterrent institution. Building on these issues, the current research has three objectives. First, we use a propensity score matching approach to estimate causal effects of marriage on crime in early adulthood. Second, we assess sex differences in the effects of marriage on offending. Although both marriage and offending are highly gendered phenomena, prior work typically focuses on males. Third, we examine whether one's propensity to marry conditions the deterrent capacity of marriage. Results show that marriage suppresses offending for males, even when accounting for their likelihood to marry. Furthermore, males who are least likely to marry seem to benefit most from this institution. The influence of marriage on crime is less robust for females, where marriage reduces crime only for those with moderate propensities to marry. We discuss these findings in the context of recent debates concerning gender, criminal offending, and the life course. ¬© 2007 by the American Society of Criminology.	Article	 United States

The Canadian government has introduced numerous policies, guidelines, and mandates at the federal and provincial levels that recognize woman abuse as a serious social problem and violation of the law. Nonetheless, recent feminist research continues to expose laws and practices that fail woman abuse victims. The present study examined the experiences of women victims in domestic violence cases and the barriers they faced in dealing with the police, the courts, and social service agencies. Despite government initiatives, the study results corroborate previous findings indicating that many battered women feel further traumatized by ambivalent or discriminatory attitudes and practices prevalent within the system. ¬© 2006 Sage Publications.

In this study, prospective path analysis was used to examine the relationship between sexual refusal assertiveness and sexual victimization over time among a community sample of women. Results provide support for a reciprocal relationship, with historical victimization predicting low sexual assertiveness and low sexual assertiveness predicting subsequent victimization. The effect of recent sexual victimization on subsequent sexual assertiveness also was replicated prospectively. These findings suggest that strengthening sexual assertiveness may help reduce vulnerability to future victimization. ¬© 2007 Sage Publications.	Article	 United States
2-s2.0-85047491507	2018	Journal of International Women's Studies	Ideological inequalities: Khmer culture and widows' perception of remarriage	To explain the enduring persistence of gender inequality, structural explanations alone are not sufficient. One must look at the realm of cultural ideas to understand the entrenched nature of female subordination. Ideological inequalities embedded in cultural beliefs and practices sustain and perpetuate structural inequalities. This article explores ideological inequalities in Cambodian culture as an explanation for the reluctance of rural widows to remarry, despite the economic benefits that a new husband would likely bring. Using concepts from the theory of the social construction of reality, two cultural sources for widows' reluctance are considered, the beliefs and practices of Khmer Buddhism and the chbab srey, an influential moral code for women. The article theorizes that widows shy away from remarriage because Khmer religious and social customs place women into an ideologically subordinate position in the household. Widows fear that in a new marriage, they would lose control over their household and their children's lives. By remaining widows, they have cultural space to reject female subordination, maintain control of their household, and focus on their role as mothers to earn religious merit for their next life. Instead of ideological inequalities that subordinate women, modified cultural arrangements can create ideological equalities that nurture both men and women. ¬© 2018 Bridgewater State College.

Yet, less is known about the role of gender in women‚Äôs offending and little consideration is directed toward the integration of gender and parenthood in understanding offending trajectories. This article examines how and when offending and desisting pathways are shaped by motherhood. Interviews were conducted with 37 mothers in New York City with histories of offending behaviors. The data demonstrate how motherhood and maternal identities held more significance in some social circumstances, contributing to offending pathways and presenting a variety of challenges in some women‚Äôs desistance pathways. ¬© The Author(s) 2018.

2-s2.0-84982273033	2017	Sex Roles	The Effect of Occupational Gender Stereotypes on Men‚Äôs Interest in Female-Dominated Occupations	A great deal of research has sought to explain women‚Äôs lower interest in male-dominated occupations, but relatively little attention has been given to explaining men‚Äôs disinterest in female-dominated occupations. Examining factors that affect men‚Äôs interest in female-dominated occupations has both theoretical and practical implications. Two factors hypothesized to alter the gender-stereotype salience of an occupation were examined: occupation titles and gender-stereotyped occupation descriptions. We hypothesized that men who reported higher levels of stereotypical feminine attributes would be more interested in feminine-stereotyped occupations. College-aged participants (N¬†=¬†1001, 791 male) enrolled in an engineering, computer science, or physics course recorded their interest in occupations with or without a feminine title and described with either feminine or masculine stereotyped skills and attributes. Participants also reported the degree to which they held stereotypical feminine attributes. Results indicated that men showed greater interest in no-title occupations, especially when masculine characteristics were used in the description. For men, self-reported levels of feminine attributes were associated with interest in occupations with feminine descriptions, primarily in the no-title condition. Women expressed more interested than did men in the occupations, but unlike men, women were equally interested in occupations with feminine and masculine descriptions. Findings are consistent with the theories of precluded interest (Cheryan 2010) and circumscription and compromise (Gottfredson 1981). It is concluded that a key for attracting men to female-dominated vocations may be to provide opportunities for men to consider an occupation in ways that prevent or disrupt comparison to traditional stereotypic archetypes. ¬© 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

2-s2.0-84861416787	2012	Management Science	Beyond the glass ceiling: Does gender matter?	A large literature documents that women are different from men in their choices and preferences, but little is known about gender differences in the boardroom. If women must be like men to break the glass ceiling, we might expect gender differences to disappear among directors. Using a large survey of directors, we show that female and male directors differ systematically in their core values and risk attitudes, but in ways that differ from gender differences in the general population. These results are robust to controlling for differences in observable characteristics. Consistent with findings for the population, female directors are more benevolent and universally concerned but less power oriented than male directors. However, in contrast to findings for the population, they are less tradition and security oriented than their male counterparts. They are also more risk loving than male directors. Thus, having a woman on the board need not lead to more risk-averse decision making. ¬© 2012 INFORMS.	Article	 Spain
2-s2.0-69149107666	2009	Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin	Gender, intimacy, and risky sex: A Terror management account	Three studies tested whether mortality salience would lead men to be more sexually risky than women. In Study 1, men reported greater intentions to engage in risky sexual behaviors than did women after a mortality prime, but not after a control prime. In Study 2, men desired more future sexual partners and had a lower need for intimacy than did women, but again, only when mortality was salient. Furthermore, need for romantic intimacy mediated the relationship between mortality salience, gender, and desired number of future partners. Using a behavioral rather than a self-reported dependent measure, Study 3 showed that men primed with mortality were less likely than women to select a package of condoms (versus a pen) as a free gift after the experiment. Implications for gender differences in responses to mortality salience, as well as for how to design effective safe-sex interventions, are discussed. ¬© 2009 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.

2-s2.0-33644790108	2006	Violence and Victims	Influence of gender and experience on college students' stalking schemas	Although stalking has been increasingly recognized as a serious social problem, surprisingly few studies have investigated perceptions of the specific behaviors that comprise stalking. The focus of this article, therefore, was to further delineate college students' stalking schemas and to examine the influence of gender and personal knowledge of stalking on their schemas. Participants judged whether or not a variety of behaviors were examples of stalking. Behaviors were designed to range from mild, somewhat ambiguous, examples of stalking to more severe examples. Results revealed an interaction between gender and experience on ratings of mild stalking behaviors. Men who had personal knowledge of stalking (by having been stalked themselves or knowing someone who had been stalked) were significantly more likely to rate mild stalking behaviors as stalking than men who had no experience. In contrast, experience did not affect women's perceptions of mild stalking, as no differences were found between women as a function of experience. Results are discussed in terms of overall relationship schemas. ¬© 2006 Springer Publishing Company.	Article	 United States

The author draws on feminist and postcolonial approaches to migration studies that highlight the active role women play in migratory processes as well as how intersectional variables of ethnic origin, socioeconomic class, education and family contexts are articulated, configuring different power relations and resources in specific sociohistorical contexts. The results challenge widespread stereotypes about migrant women by revealing a rich diversity of profiles, motivations and migratory pathways, as well as how informants‚Äô experiences of social activism across national borders have transformed their subject formation processes and re-positioned them as active subjects of political action. ¬© 2017, ¬© The Author(s) 2017.

The data production was supported by participant observation within the streets, in a country town from Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The creation of cultural fields guided the analysis: the relation with the Other on the street; gender relations; and relation with the healthcare services. The data interpretation was based on a psychosocial perspective and on authors that study homeless population. The conclusion indicated that the observed women living on the street represent a very diverse population in its characteristics and complex in its needs, demanding care that takes into account a variety of transversalities, especially those which refer to interactions and relations established within its boundaries. ¬© 2017, Fundacion para el Avance de la Psicologia.

2-s2.0-85016496107	2017	Feminist Media Studies	At home with their queerness: same-sex relationality and the Indian family in advertising media	The legal battle around the reform of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code brought the provisional decriminalization of homosexuality in 2009, which was overturned by the Supreme Court of India in 2013. Queer politics in India thus stands at a critical juncture regarding the goal to foster social acceptance of LGBT individuals. This paper offers an analysis of two recent media representations in India‚Äîa gay matrimonial ad and an online advertisement for an ethnic apparel brand featuring a lesbian couple‚Äîto demonstrate how the Indian family is emerging as an important arbiter of queer relationality. The negotiation of same-sex relations within the familial is premised on bourgeois notions of class, caste and gender, an ideological normativity that queer of color critique and queer theory have foundationally put up resistance to. This paper goes beyond the queer and feminist critiques of gender and class normativity to suggest that queer visibility in the Indian context is being negotiated not in opposition to, but through, the mandates of the familial. ¬© 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

2-s2.0-84922272011	2015	American Sociological Review	Can We Finish the Revolution? Gender, Work-Family Ideals, and Institutional Constraint	Why has progress toward gender equality in the workplace and at home stalled in recent decades? A growing body of scholarship suggests that persistently gendered workplace norms and policies limit men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs ability to create gender egalitarian relationships at home. In this article, we build on and extend prior research by examining the extent to which institutional constraints, including workplace policies, affect young, unmarried men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs preferences for their future work-family arrangements. We also examine how these effects vary across education levels. Drawing on original survey-experimental data, we ask respondents how they would like to structure their future relationships while experimentally manipulating the degree of institutional constraint under which they state their preferences. Two clear patterns emerge. First, as constraints are removed and men and women can opt for an egalitarian relationship, the majority choose this option, regardless of gender or education level. Second, women‚Äôs relationship structure preferences are more responsive than men‚Äôs to the removal of institutional constraints through supportive work-family policy interventions. These findings shed light on important questions about the role of institutions in shaping work-family preferences, underscoring the notion that seemingly gender-traditional work-family decisions are largely contingent on the constraints of current workplaces. ¬© American Sociological Association 2015.

Our sample comprised N = 81 respondents from an urban area in Germany (average age: 42.9 years; average tenure: 11.4 years). In Germany, primary school teaching is a numerically female-dominated occupation. We found that masculinity, femininity, and androgyny positively influenced well-being, while gender-role conflict was negatively interrelated with well-being. We expected that gender-role conflict weakens the positive effects of masculinity and femininity. Unexpectedly, we even found a detrimental effect of femininity when gender-role conflict was high: For respondents reporting comparatively high gender-role conflict, femininity was associated with lower work satisfaction. ¬© 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

2-s2.0-84870908672	2012	Sexuality Research and Social Policy	Prostitution policy models and feminist knowledge politics in New Zealand and Sweden	This article analyses expert discourse on prostitution in New Zealand and Sweden using governmentality theory. The article shows that in both cases, experts adopted research methodologies based in criticism of past research as supporting heterosexual male hegemony. New Zealand experts emphasized giving voice to prostitutes as a marginalized, predominately female population and producing research that benefited them. Swedish experts argued that research should focus upon global sex markets and hegemonic masculinities, successfully advocating criminalizing clients and pimps, but not prostitutes. The article argues that both policies exemplify contrasting advanced liberal governmental techniques. In New Zealand, the critical methodology of attention to prostitute voices informed techniques of agency which sought to empower sex workers to manage their own health and human rights problems. In Sweden, the methodology of studying up informed advanced liberal authoritarian techniques which disciplined and punished sex buyers in the interests of their own freedom and in conformity with Swedish constructions of freedom. In each case, advanced liberal governmentality instrumentalized knowledge produced by critical feminist research methodologies to inform governmental techniques that produced localized gendered norms of personhood. ¬© Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.

Body dissatisfaction scores worsened after viewing images of women who exemplified cultural standards of the thin beauty ideal. Neither objectified body consciousness nor body mass index predicted degree of change in body dissatisfaction after viewing the images. In other words, the impact of viewing the images was the same for all women, despite varying body mass index levels and varied degrees of objectified body consciousness.

Results from 80 teams working on an idea generation task indicated that the activation of gender faultlines negatively affected the number and overall creativity of ideas. However, gender faultlines that were not activated had no effect. Results also indicated that the relationship between activated gender faultlines and team creativity was partially mediated by the level of conflict within the team. Specifically, emotional conflict partially mediated the effects of activated gender faultlines on the number of ideas generated.

This article reports on an online survey completed by 160 trans or gender diverse people. The survey included general demographic questions, in addition to questions related to (1) current parenting arrangements, (2) modes of family formation, (3) the desire to have children in the future, and (4) support or discrimination from families of origin. In regard to the findings, only a minority of participants (39) were already parents; however 21 participants indicated that they desired to have children in the future. Participants who were already parents were older than those who were not, and conversely, participants who desired to have children in the future were younger than those who did not. Discrimination from family of origin was negatively correlated with support for parenting, while support from family of origin was positively correlated with desire to have children. The paper concludes by suggesting that support from service providers is important for this potentially vulnerable group who may not experience support from their families of origin and who may perceive themselves as having limited pathways to parenthood. ¬© 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The mean age of participants was 14.3 (SD¬†=¬†.72) with age ranging from 8 to 16¬†years. The independent variables were age, gender and perceived self-control. The outcome variable was future goals measured with Snyder et al. J Pediatr Psychol, 22(3), 399‚Äì421, (1997) children hope scale. Results showed that there is a significant difference between pre-adolescents and adolescents in their orientation towards future goals {F(1, 93)¬†=¬†23.65, p¬†<¬†0.05}. Results further showed that male and female participants did not differ significantly in their orientation towards future goals {F(1, 93)¬†=¬†0.54, p¬†>¬†0.05}.
